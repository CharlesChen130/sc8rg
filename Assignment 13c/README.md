# Sprint 6 SSO Project
This project is currently live at: https://cs-heidelberg-staging.herokuapp.com/home

This is worked together with the cs4380 database final project.   
In the website, you can register and then login. After you register, your account's information will be stored in firebase. After you successfully login, you can access the data in database and use the functions.  
(Or you can use Email:Hi@g.com Password:123456 to login.)

To run the code using localhost, you need to download all the files and use npm. 
cd Assignment\ 13c
cd Frontend
ng serve

And then open another terminal:
cd Assignment\ 13c
nodemon server.js

And then use http://localhost:4200/ to access the website.
