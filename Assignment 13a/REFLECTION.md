The project I looked at is https://sailsjs.com/.   
I chose to use Sails.js because its page looks the clearest for me to understand. It looks very clear.   
I was trying to design a login page of this Sails.js. I don't have any website design knowledge before and I really tried my best on this website design now though it doesn't work. I don't know how to link them together.
