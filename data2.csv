0,0,Ecological momentary assessment of interpersonal theory of suicide constructs in people experiencing psychotic symptoms,"Background: People with psychotic disorders are at an increased risk of suicide, but there is little understanding of suicidal ideation (SI) in this population. The Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide posits that perceived burdensomeness (PB) and thwarted belonginess (TB) contribute to SI. To our knowledge there are no studies using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to assess these interpersonal risk factors in a sample of individuals with psychotic disorders. This study investigated the validity and variability of PB and TB, and whether SI, EMAmeasured psychotic symptoms, mood, and social context relate to PB and TB. Method: Ninety-six participants with a psychotic disorder, including mood disorders with psychosis completed inlab assessments of current SI, and then EMA surveys on a smartphone 3/day for 10 days, answering questions about burdensomeness, belongingness, symptoms (i.e., hearing voices, experiencing suspiciousness), mood (i.e., happy, sad), and social context. Results: Burdensomeness varied within-participants less than belongingness (t (95) = -3.74, p=< .001). Participants with SI had higher mean burdensomeness ratings (t (94) = -2.70, p < .01) and lower mean belongingness ratings (t (94) = 3.68, p < .001) than did participants without SI. Being with others, greater psychotic experiences, less happiness, and greater sadness related to greater burdensomeness. SI status, being alone, greater psychotic experiences, less happiness, and greater sadness related to less belongingness. Conclusions: This study examined the real-time influences of SI and psychotic symptoms on burdensomeness and belongingness. Hearing voices, suspiciousness, mood, and SI are related to interpersonal suicide-related risk factors. In this sample, social context had a differential effect on burdensomeness and belongingness.","[""Schizophrenia"", ""Schizoaffective disorder"", ""Bipolar disorder"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""EMA"", ""Suicide"", ""Psychosis""]",10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.06.022,
1,1,The after-effects of momentary suicidal ideation: A preliminary examination of emotion intensity changes following suicidal thoughts,"Research using ecological momentary assessments has highlighted the importance of negative emotions as predictors of day-to-day suicidal thoughts. Yet only one study has examined the real-time consequences of these thoughts. This preliminary investigation examined changes in emotion intensity following suicidal thoughts. It also explored associations between these changes and endorsement of suicide functions as an escape and/or as a solution, examined both as momentary thoughts and intractable beliefs about suicide. Thirty-nine community participants endorsing suicidal ideation were followed for two-weeks and completed multiple daily surveys related to suicidal thoughts, functions of suicide, and emotion intensity. Participants reported heightened emotion intensity immediately following a suicidal thought across six emotions, with delayed reductions in stress and anxiety following ideation onset. When assessed in the moment, suicide as a solution to a problem predicted increases in hopelessness, sadness, stress and general negative affect immediately following a thought, while suicide as an escape predicted increases in anger immediately after a thought. When measured as intractable beliefs, only stronger belief in suicide as a solution to a problem predicted delayed reductions in stress following ideation. Increased intensity of negative emotions immediately following suicidal ideation suggests a potential vicious cycle of heightened emotion intensity and suicidality.","[""Suicidality"", ""Experience sampling"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Real-time assessment"", ""Negative reinforcement""]",10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114027,
2,2,Across-subjects multiple baseline trial of exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for severe irritability: a study protocol,"Introduction Irritability is defined as a tendency towards anger in response to frustration. Clinically, impairing irritability is a significant public health problem. There is a need for mechanism-based psychotherapies targeting severe irritability as it manifests in the context of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). This study protocol describes a randomised multiple baseline design testing the preliminary efficacy of a new treatment, exposurebased cognitive-behavioral therapy for severe irritability in youth, which also integrates components of parent management training. We will investigate associations of this intervention with primary clinical measures, as well as ecological momentary assessment measures. Methods and analysis Forty youth will be enrolled. Participants, aged 8-17 years, must present at least one of two core symptoms of DMDD: abnormal mood or increased reactivity to negative emotional stimuli, with severe impairment in one domain (home, school, peers) and moderate in another, or moderate impairment in at least two domains. Each participant is randomised to a 2-week, 4-week or 6-week baseline observation period, followed by 12 active treatment sessions. Clinical ratings are conducted at baseline, biweekly (clinician), weekly (parent/child) throughout treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month and 6-month follow-up (clinician). Clinician ratings on the Affective Reactivity Index and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale for DMDD are our primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures include parent and child reports of irritability. Post hoc additional symptom measures include clinician, parent and self-ratings of depression, anxiety and overall functional impairment. Prospective, digitally based event sampling of symptoms is acquired for a week pretreatment, mid-treatment and post-treatment. Based on our pathophysiological model of irritability implicating frustrative non-reward, aberrant threat processing and instrumental learning, we probe these three brain-based targets using functional MRI paradigms to assess target engagement. Ethics and dissemination The research project and all related materials were submitted and approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).Trial registration numbers NCT02531893 and NCT00025935.","[""child & adolescent psychiatry"", ""depression & mood disorders"", ""neurobiology"", ""therapeutics""]",10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039169,
3,3,An Ecological Momentary Assessment of College Women's Decisions to Use Protective Behavioral Strategies,"Protective behavioral strategies (PBS) have been associated with reduced risk for sexual assault victimization in college women. Sexual assault risk reduction programs have had limited success increasing PBS use, particularly among heavy drinkers, suggesting a need for additional research on the malleable predictors of PBS use. Whereas longitudinal studies show women's decisions to use PBS can be both planned and reactive, little is known about the decision-making processes that affect PBS use on drinking days, when sexual assault risk may be elevated. The current study used ecological momentary assessment to examine variability in the associations between decision-making and PBS use within and across drinking days in first-semester college women. Participants (56 female drinkers) completed a 14-day protocol with three daily measures of intentions and willingness to use PBS, and once-daily diaries of PBS use. Multilevel models examined between-day and within-day effects of intentions and willingness to use PBS with regards to sexual assault PBS (e.g., communicating sexual boundaries) and drinking PBS (e.g., limiting alcohol consumption), respectively. On days when sexual assault PBS willingness increased throughout the day, women tended  to  use  more  sexual  assault  PBS.  This  association  was  strongest  among  women  who  were  typically  less  willing  to  use  these  PBS.  Among  women who were the least willing to use drinking PBS, their drinking PBS use decreased  on  days  when  they  reported  increased  willingness  to  use  them.  Decisions  to  use  sexual  assault  and  drinking  PBS  on  drinking  days  were qualified by women¡¯s typical levels of willingness to use the different PBS.  This  suggests  the  need  for  a  multi-faceted  intervention  strategy  that  targets both typical and event-level risk. Individual-level alcohol and sexual assault risk reduction approaches could be enhanced with event-level PBS messaging and evaluation","[""ecological  momentary  assessment"",  ""protective  behavioral  strategies"",  ""sexual  assault risk"", ""alcohol consumption"", ""college women""]",10.1177/08862605211005143,"Nearly one quarter of college women experience sexual assault in the United States . Risk for victimization is particularly high among younger students (i.e., those under the age of 21) who engage in heavy episodic drinking (HED; i.e., consuming four or more drinks on a single occasion; . Even women who typically consume less are at increased risk on days when they consume more than their typical amounts . The underlying mechanisms that explain the association between alcohol and sexual assault risk are well-established and multifaceted (see . Studies show that men perceive intoxicated women to be more sexually available or interested ; women who are drinking heavily also have a delayed recognition of and response to sexual assault risk. As such, perpetrators may be more inclined to prey on women who are drinking. Although sexual assault risk only exists in the presence of a perpetrator, alcohol is involved in over 50% of sexual assaults that occur on college campuses , warranting prevention strategies that address alcohol-related risk . Sexual assault risk reduction programs are an integral component of comprehensive prevention efforts and address multiple risk and protective factors . Risk reduction programs assert sexual assault is always the perpetrator's fault and also empower women to minimize the likelihood they will be targeted as a potential victim . A core mechanism of this prevention approach has been to increase use of sexual assault protective behavioral strategies (PBS; . Sexual assault PBS include strategies for setting and communicating personal boundaries (e.g., determining in advance what one is willing to do in a sexual situation) and deterring harm in situations where sexual assault risk may be present (e.g., walking home with trusted friends, being prepared to use forceful verbal or physical resistance strategies if necessary; . Several attempts have been made to tailor this risk reduction approach for heavy drinking women . These programs have typically expanded the discussion of PBS to include drinking PBS, which aim to limit alcohol consumption (e.g., consuming no more than one drink per hour; planning not to exceed three drinks in a night) or modify the manner of drinking (e.g., alternating alcohol and non-alcoholic beverages; avoiding shots) to minimize the potential negative effects of intoxication . Whereas sexual assault PBS have been directly associated with decreased sexual assault victimization in college women , drinking PBS have been indirectly associated with fewer incidents of forced and unwanted sex by first reducing alcohol consumption . Several rigorous evaluation studies of risk reduction programs have reported significant effects on sexual assault victimization (e.g.,  and alcohol-involved sexual assault, specifically . Program impacts on PBS use have been less consistent, especially in samples of heavy drinkers . This gap could be a function of measurement specificity. Prospective evaluation studies measure typical PBS use averaged over several months . This level of measurement does not account for whether or how women tailor their PBS use in response to interpersonal or contextual risk on a given day. Existing programs may also be insufficiently addressing the upstream factors that motivate an individual to use PBS . Relatively little is known about the processes that inform women's decisions to use PBS, and no studies have examined these processes on days when women drink and may be at increased risk for victimization. A better understanding of the malleable constructs that inform PBS use on drinking days is needed to enhance prevention efforts. Decisions to Use PBS Research shows women's decisions to use PBS can be complex, operating through core processes that are both planned (i.e., intentional) and emotionally reactive (i.e., one's willingness to use PBS based on the social situation; . Studies reveal that intentions and willingness tend to be positively associated, but when examined simultaneously, they each account for significant unique variance in predicting behavioral outcomes (e.g., .  observed women's intentions and willingness were positively correlated with each other (r = .78), but each accounted for unique and significant proportions of variance in predicting future sexual assault PBS use. The role of intentions in PBS use is consistent with prior literature that has shown positive health behaviors (e.g., healthy eating) tend to be more intentional or planned compared to health risk behaviors (e.g., substance use), which tend to be more reactive . Studies such as these tend to examine associations between intentions/willingness assessed at one time and behavioral outcomes assessed a month to several months later. The limitation of this approach is that it does not account for situational changes in decision making or PBS use. The current study attempted to fill this gap by examining event-level intentions and willingness to use PBS and behavioral outcomes on days when women might be at increased risk for victimization. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is an event-level methodology that allows for repeated measurement of events, experiences, or behaviors as they occur in real time and in participants' natural environments . The EMA approach provides a method to examine the answers to more nuanced process-based questions, such as: (a) Does the influence of decision-theoretical constructs (intentions and willingness) on PBS use vary from day to day? (b) Does the influence vary within a day leading up to a drinking event? (c) Is the influence of within-or between-day variability affected by individuals' typical decision-making patterns? Answers to these questions could provide insight into factors that decrease risk on a given day and inform the optimal timing and theoretical targets for interventions. For example, observed variability in the influence of intentions on PBS use from one day to the next might suggest existing risk reduction programs could be enhanced by encouraging women to consistently plan for what PBS they might use when they go out. Alternatively, observing variability within a day (e.g., if PBS use becomes more likely as intentions increase throughout the day) might suggest the need for supplemental event-specific interventions that make PBS use seem appealing right before or throughout a night out. Understanding these processes can help inform the nature of prevention efforts to increase overall PBS use, empower women to think about which PBS may be most beneficial in different situations, and subsequently reduce harm. The Current Study The current study used a 14-day EMA design to examine decision-making constructs associated with sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS. To understand the decision-making processes women use on days when they could be at increased risk for victimization, the current study examined PBS used only on drinking days. Further, drinking days are plausible and easily identifiable targets for intervention, both globally and at the event-level. Research suggests that, on average, women use more sexual assault PBS when they have greater intentions and willingness to do so . The current study aimed to explore these associations at the event level for both sexual assault and drinking PBS by answering the following research questions (RQ): (a) Do women use more sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so are higher than normal (e.g., withinperson/between-day effects)? (b) Do women use more sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so increase throughout the day, relative to when they decrease or stay the same (e.g., within-day effects)? (c) Do event-level associations between PBS use and decision-theoretical constructs vary based on one's average overall levels of intentions and willingness (e.g., between-person by within-person interaction effects)? These hypothesized associations were tested separately for sexual assault and drinking PBS because they may require unique intervention approaches for increased use. The effects of intentions and willingness were examined simultaneously (e.g., the effect of willingness controlling for one's average level of intentions) because previous research has identified both as being integral and complementary in the behavioral decision-making process . Answers to these questions will provide critical insight into how typical risk reduction approaches might be enhanced to address HED and event-level risk. Method Recruitment A random sample of 750 women was selected from the university registrar's database of incoming students at a large, public northeastern university. Students received personalized introductory letters and email invitations describing the study and containing a URL and PIN for accessing a consent form and brief web-based screening survey. Non-respondents received up to seven personalized email reminders. Approximately, 58% (n = 436) enrolled and completed the screening, resulting in a response rate comparable to other studies using similar web-based recruitment methods with new students transitioning into the university (e.g., . Over half of enrolled students met eligibility criteria (54%; n = 235), which included (a) having a 4G network smartphone and (b) reporting at least one heavy drinking episode in the past month (i.e., consuming four or more drinks on a single occasion; . Ineligible students were paid $5 and removed from the participant list. Eligible students were directed to the baseline assessment and paid $15 for their time. Students also earned a $5 rapid completion bonus if they completed the survey within 3 days of the initial invitation. EMA Study Procedures Following baseline assessment, two-thirds of participants (n = 156) were randomly selected for the EMA study; the remaining third was assigned to a reactivity control group. Students assigned to the current study were directed to a scheduling tool and invited to continue in the study by signing up for a required training on Snap Mobile, a mobile phone application used for daily data collection. Research staff made up to two phone calls and sent three additional emails to follow up with eligible students who did not schedule electronically or to reschedule participants who missed their scheduled session; participants also received text message reminders the night before their selected training session. Approximately, 54% (n = 84) of those invited, or 19% of all screened participants, attended training and enrolled in the EMA study. There were no significant differences between students who enrolled and students who did not enroll on age, race/ethnicity, baseline drinking, or PBS use (all ps > .05). The current study employed a 14-day event-and signal-contingent EMA protocol. Upon waking each morning, participants logged into their Snap Mobile app to complete a short survey of the previous day's drinking and PBS use. At the end of this morning survey, participants also completed their first prospective momentary assessments of intentions and willingness to use PBS on that day. Two additional momentary assessments of intentions and willingness occurred randomly between 2:00 pm and 6:00 pm and between 7:00 pm and 11:00 pm each day. Text message reminders were sent at 9:00 am on weekdays/10:00 am on weekends, and again at 12:30 pm for daily diaries (the survey closed at 1:00 pm daily); reminders for the afternoon and evening momentary assessments were sent 30 minutes before each survey period closed. Participants received $30 for participation, with a $20 bonus if they achieved at least 90% compliance on the daily morning assessments. To further encourage compliance, participants were entered into a lottery for each survey they completed; five lottery winners were randomly selected at the end of the study, with prizes ranging from $50 to $250. All study procedures were reviewed and approved by the university's Institutional Review Board. Participants Only the days on which participants reported drinking were included in analyses, as the current study aimed to understand PBS use on drinking days. The final sample included 56 participants who reported at least 1 drinking event during the 14-day assessment period with corresponding momentary data from the prior day. The mean age of the sample was 18.05 years (SD = 0.23). Most participants identified as Caucasian (82.1%), although other racial/ethnic backgrounds were represented (10.7% African American, 5.4% multiracial, 5.5% Hispanic). All participants lived on campus, and many intended to join intramural/club sports (55.4%) or sororities (42.9%) in their first semester. At baseline, participants reported consuming an average of 8.71 (SD = 6.06) drinks per week. Measures PBS If participants reported drinking the day/night before, within their daily waking recall assessments, they were asked to indicate which, if any, PBS they used (1 = Yes; 0 = No). For both types of PBS, briefer versions of established scales were used to keep daily assessments short and minimize response burden . The sexual assault PBS measure included six items from the Dating Self-Protection Against Rape Scale . Items were selected based on preliminary work identifying the types of behaviors women tend to use most frequently . Sample items included, ""Letting a friend or family member know where you are,"" and ""Walking home with a trusted friend."" A summed score was created to indicate the number of sexual assault PBS used on each drinking occasion. The drinking PBS measure included six items from the Protective Behavioral Strategies Scale . Items with factor loadings of at least 0.65  were selected from each subscale, including Stopping/Limiting Drinking (e.g., determined in advance not to exceed a set number of drinks), Manner of Drinking (e.g., avoided trying to keep up with or out drink others), and Serious Harm Reduction (e.g., tried to know where my drink was at all times). A summed score was created to indicate the number of drinking PBS used on each drinking occasion. Behavior-specific Intentions Each of the three daily momentary assessments asked participants about the activities they intended to engage in later that day. They were asked, ""Do you 'intend' to engage in any social activities today/tonight?"" (1 = Yes; 0 = No) and ""Do you 'intend' to drink?"" (1 = Yes; 0 = No). If drinking intentions were affirmed, participants also indicated which, if any, PBS from the lists above they intended to use (1 = Yes; 0 = No). Summed scores were created to indicate the number of sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS participants intended to use within each drinking occasion. Behavior-specific Willingness Similar to intentions, participants were presented with willingness questions specific to each behavior. They were asked, ""Are you 'willing' to engage in social activities tonight, should the opportunity arise?"" (1 = Yes; 0 = No) and ""Are you 'willing' to drink?"" (1 = Yes; 0 = No). If affirmed, participants indicated which sexual assault and drinking PBS they were willing to use (1 = Yes; 0 = No). Summed scores indicated the number of sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS participants were willing to use on each occasion. Analytic Strategy A series of four multilevel regression models were estimated in SAS (v. 9.4) to examine within-person/between-day effects (RQ1), within-day effects (RQ2), and cross-level interaction effects (RQ3; between-person X withinperson/day) of decision-theoretic constructs (intentions and willingness) on daily PBS use. Prior to analysis, waking recall assessments of the prior day's PBS use were lagged by one day and merged to match with the previous day's momentary assessments of intentions and willingness. Because predictor variables were assessed at a lower level (within day) than the outcome variables (between day), the lower level data (three momentary assessments of intentions and willingness within a day) were aggregated . Within-day aggregation was conducted in two ways to answer unique research questions. First, all three momentary assessments were averaged to create a day-level mean for intentions and willingness to use sexual assault and drinking PBS, respectively (RQ1). The second aggregation method created behavior-specific change scores ) by subtracting intention and willingness values reported at the first assessment within each day from the value reported at the third assessment within each day (RQ2). Positive values indicated an increase in intentions or willingness throughout the day, whereas negative values indicated a decrease. Missing data within the final analytic sample were handled using Full Information Maximum Likelihood , and outcome-specific unconditional means models confirmed the utility of the intended multilevel approach. The first set of models examined whether daily intentions and willingness to use PBS predicted actual PBS use on a given drinking day. Each behavioral outcome (sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS) was regressed onto behavior-specific day-level means of intentions and willingness. For example, sexual assault PBS use was regressed onto day-level means of intentions and willingness to use sexual assault PBS. To separate within-and betweenperson effects, predictors were group-mean centered at Level 1 (i.e., centered around the individual's mean) and grand-mean centered at Level 2 (i.e., centered around the sample mean). A second set of models examined whether within-day changes in intentions and willingness to use PBS predicted PBS use on a given drinking day. Again, using separate models for sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS, each behavioral outcome was regressed onto behavior-specific within-day changes in intentions and willingness to use PBS at Level 1 and grand-mean centered intentions and willingness to use PBS at Level 2. Within each model, we estimated both main effects (RQ1 & RQ2) and within-domain cross-level interactions (e.g., Level 1 intentions × Level 2 intentions; Level 1 willingness × Level 2 willingness; RQ3). Results Participants provided 368 total assessments (M = 6.57/person). Intraclass correlation coefficients from the unconditional means models indicated .85 of the variability in sexual assault PBS and .78 of the variability in drinking PBS occurred between-persons, leaving 15% and 22% of the variability, respectively, to be accounted for at the event-level. Results from the multilevel models predicting both sexual assault and drinking PBS are included in Table . For each outcome, results of RQ1 (between-day effects of intentions and willingness) are presented in the top panel and results of RQ2 (withinday changes in intentions and willingness) are presented in the bottom panel. The cross-level interaction terms within each panel (Rows 6, 7, 12, and 13) represent results for RQ3. Each will be discussed in turn. On any given drinking day, assuming average levels of PBS intentions and willingness, women used 2.76 (SE = 0.12) sexual assault PBS and 2.90 (SE = 0.17) drinking PBS (Table , Row 1). The main effects of daily intentions and willingness to use PBS on PBS use were not significant for either outcome (Rows 4 and 5). Thus, there was no evidence to suggest women used more sexual assault PBS or drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so were higher than normal. RQ2: Do Women Use More PBS on Days When Their Intentions and Willingness to Do So Increase Throughout the Day? Consistent with the first set of models, on any given drinking day, and assuming average intentions and willingness, women used 2.76 (SE = 0.13) sexual assault PBS and 2.74 (SE = 0.19) drinking PBS (Table , Row 8). There was a positive association between within-day changes in willingness and sexual assault PBS use (Row 12), such that at average levels of intentions, each 1-unit increase in willingness was associated with a 0.15 (SE = 0.06) increase in PBS use. In other words, women reported their highest sexual assault PBS use on days when their willingness to use sexual assault PBS increased throughout the day. Within-day changes in intentions to use sexual assault PBS were not significantly associated with sexual assault PBS use (Row 11). There were no significant associations between within-day changes in intentions and willingness and drinking PBS use (Rows 11 and 12). RQ3: Do Event-level Associations Between PBS Use and Decision-theoretical Constructs Vary Based on One's Average Overall Levels of Intentions and Willingness? Sexual Assault PBS Across both models, and consistent with global theories of behavior change (e.g., , the between-person effects of both intentions and willingness to use sexual assault PBS were positively associated with number of PBS used (Table , Rows 2, 3, 9, and 10). Individuals who reported greater intentions and willingness to use sexual assault PBS, on average, also reported using a greater number of sexual assault PBS, compared to individuals who reported lower average intentions and willingness to use sexual assault PBS. Building on this work, RQ3 examined whether event-level associations between PBS use and decision-theoretical constructs vary based on one's average overall levels of intentions and willingness. The between-person by daily average interactions were not significant (Rows 6 and 7), suggesting the non-significant event-level associations described above (RQ1) were consistent across all women in the sample; they did not vary based on one's typical levels of intentions and willingness. However, the between-person by withinday change interaction was significant for willingness to use sexual assault PBS (Row 14), suggesting the positive association between within-day changes in willingness and sexual assault PBS use (RQ2 above) might vary depending on one's typical willingness to use sexual assault PBS. To probe the nature of this interaction, the interaction was graphed in Figure . Separate lines are used to indicate the within-day association among individuals who reported (a) average (mean), (b) above-average (1 SD above the mean), and (c) below-average (1 SD below the mean) levels of overall willingness to use sexual assault PBS. The interaction was further probed by calculating the simple slopes and region of significance for each of the three between-person levels of sexual assault PBS willingness . Women who had average and below-average levels of overall willingness to use sexual assault PBS reported increased sexual assault PBS use on days when their willingness to use those PBS increased throughout the day (p < .01). This association was not significant for women with overall above-average levels of sexual assault PBS willingness; these women used the highest number of sexual assault PBS regardless of any within-day fluctuations in willingness. Drinking PBS. Across both models, the between-person association (Level 2) between willingness to use drinking PBS and PBS use was significant (Table , Rows 3 and 10), suggesting that individuals who, on average, reported willingness to use more drinking PBS also reported using a greater number of drinking PBS over the period of assessment. There was a significant cross-level interaction of between-person by daily average willingness to use drinking PBS (Row 7), suggesting that even though no event-level association between willingness and drinking PBS use was found when we examined main effects (RQ1 above), there may be an event-level association for certain individuals. Further probing (see Figure ) revealed individuals who, on average, reported the lowest overall level of drinking PBS willingness (i.e., below-average) decreased their PBS use on days when they reported more than their typical amount of willingness to use drinking PBS (p < .05). The simple slopes for the other between-person levels of drinking PBS willingness (i.e., average and aboveaverage) trended in the expected direction but were not significant. No other significant interaction effects were observed; intentions did not predict drinking PBS use at any level. Figure Effects of Between-Person Drinking PBS Willingness on the Association Discussion The current study aimed to enhance existing risk reduction programs by examining event-level variability in the decision-making processes that influence PBS use using an EMA study design. First, we examined whether women used more sexual assault and drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so were higher than normal. Findings did not support this hypothesis. This was surprising, as previous work indicates women regularly use a number of sexual assault PBS already , suggesting they are generally aware of social and environmental risks. One notable difference from this prior work was that our study focused solely on women in their first semester of college. These women may still be learning about social and environmental risk factors, suggesting a need to understand how PBS use and motivations for use differ between first year students and their more senior counterparts. At the event-level, specific contextual factors may impact women's risk perceptions and, in turn, their decisions to use sexual assault PBS on a given day. Women tend to be less willing to use sexual assault PBS in situations where they are socializing with someone they know because they do not think of that person as a potential perpetrator . Students may also be less willing to use drinking PBS if they have competing intentions to drink, as drinking PBS focus on limiting alcohol consumption. This effect might be heightened by affiliation with groups that support a heavy drinking culture (e.g., athletic teams, Greek life). Future event-level studies of PBS decision making should examine the role of contextual factors, such as with whom and in what environments women socialize, and between-person differences that might further explain event-level processes. Next, we asked whether women used more sexual assault and drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so increased throughout the day relative to days when their intentions and willingness decreased or stayed the same. Whereas no significant findings were observed for drinking PBS, women reported their highest sexual assault PBS use on days when their willingness to use sexual assault PBS increased throughout the day. This might suggest that women adjust their sexual assault PBS as they coordinate with friends or learn more about their plans through the day (e.g., where they are going, who they will see). Future research should explore what factors impact shifts in sexual assault PBS willingness, as well as between-person differences in who adjusts their willingness and PBS use versus those who do not. Interventions might be enhanced by encouraging women to learn as much as possible about the events they plan to attend (e.g., where they are going, what could happen in that setting) so they can proactively consider which PBS they might be willing to use in each situation. The third research question examined whether event-level associations between PBS use and willingness and intentions varied based on individuals' average levels of willingness and intentions. Consistent with global theories of behavior change and prior PBS-specific studies (e.g., , we did observe significant between-person effects such that women who reported more willingness to use both types of PBS, on average, also endorsed greater use. The between-person effect of intentions was significant for sexual assault PBS only, indicating women who reported higher average intentions were more likely to use PBS such as walking home with a friend. The impact of these between-person effects on event-level decision making varied based on the PBS type. For sexual assault PBS, a significant between-person by within-day change interaction was observed. Women who had below-average and average levels of willingness to use sexual assault PBS reported the highest actual use on days when their willingness to use sexual assault PBS increased; this pattern was not observed for women with above-average levels of overall willingness. Examination of Figure  suggests we may be observing a ceiling effect among above-average sexual assault PBS users. These women are regularly using sexual assault PBS at high rates with little room to increase. Findings suggest women who typically are less willing to use sexual assault PBS may benefit from eventlevel types of intervention to increase their willingness prior to higher risk occasions involving alcohol or potential sexual encounters , and that existing prevention efforts could focus on positively reinforcing the PBS use that is already happening. When examining cross-level interactions for drinking PBS, a different pattern of findings emerged. We observed a significant between-person by daily average interaction for willingness to use drinking PBS; women who tended to have the lowest overall willingness to use drinking PBS actually decreased their drinking PBS use on days when they reported more willingness to use them. There are several possible explanations for this finding that should be explored in future work. Perhaps these women are less successful with implementing these behaviors because they may be less familiar with using them or simply do not like to use them. It is also plausible that despite being more willing to use drinking PBS in advance of a drinking event, they may find themselves in an environment where they perceive none of their peers are using them, or that none of their peers would approve of their use. These women may be particularly affected by both drinking and PBS-specific normative influences . Either way, the findings are somewhat concerning because they highlight a lack of planning to use drinking PBS, and a lack of follow-through even when willingness is high. Interventions may need to strengthen the use of drinking PBS on a global level before event-level interventions are considered, and additional research may be needed to better understand normative influences and barriers associated with drinking PBS use. Notably, intraclass correlations revealed less event-level variability in PBS use than we expected to observe (15% for sexual assault PBS; 22% for drinking PBS), which may highlight several ways in which our study design could be strengthened in subsequent research. First, to minimize participant burden we chose to focus on college students' most commonly used PBS, yet decision-making processes may be different for less common PBS, especially if those are PBS women only use out of necessity (e.g., if a situation escalates and requires forceful physical resistance; . Expanding the number and types of PBS measured may capture the full range of strategies women choose to implement. More nuanced understanding of how women combine PBS and which PBS women use in different contexts would also better inform EMA measurement, and ultimately prevention . Second, post-hoc comparison of EMA participants to a reactivity control group suggested women may have increased PBS use in response to frequent assessment. While this is encouraging when considering the utility of momentary/event-level interventions to increase PBS use, it could have also resulted in reduced variability, or even over-reporting, of PBS use in daily assessments. Finally, we aimed to understand decisions leading up to drinking events, necessarily limiting analysis to drinking days. However, not all sexual assaults involve alcohol, and a woman's decision not to drink on a given day or in a specific context may be an intentional PBS. We may capture more event-level variability by examining a broader range of PBS and decisions to use PBS on both drinking and non-drinking days. Implications for Prevention Previous research has called for the integration and increased use of both sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS to enhance existing sexual assault prevention efforts . By examining women's decisions to use (or not use) PBS on drinking days, the current study serves as an initial step in providing an evidence-based way to help women utilize a ""toolkit"" of strategies that will help them to feel empowered and in control of their environment, while also reducing the likelihood they will be perceived by perpetrators as potential victims. Overwhelmingly, the current study highlights the need to increase intentions to use drinking PBS. Practitioners may consider using existing alcohol risk reduction strategies (e.g., motivational interviewing [MI; ; personalized normative feedback [PNF; ; parent-based intervention [PBI; ) and sexual assault risk reduction programs targeting heavy drinkers (e.g.,  to encourage women to think through common social scenarios and plan for which PBS they would use to minimize potential risk. Conversations that address barriers to using drinking PBS, like competing intentions to drink, might be enhanced by providing alternative strategies that can be used even if intentions to drink are high (e.g., alternating alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages vs. limiting to three or fewer drinks).  have successfully used similar approaches to increase women's use of forceful verbal and physical sexual assault resistance strategies in their Enhanced Assess, Acknowledge, Act (EAAA) program. Findings also revealed that intentions and willingness to use PBS operate at both between-person and within-person levels and may require different strategies to achieve behavior change. To address between-person differences, individuals who are more willing to use PBS may benefit from highlighting successful outcomes from prior PBS use to reinforce positive decisions. Those who are less willing to use PBS may require more intensive efforts to increase their willingness to use PBS, perhaps by first increasing their confidence in their ability to effectively use PBS . A similar approach to target within-person differences might be to reinforce intentions/willingness throughout the day, during an actual drinking event, or even prior to a potential sexual encounter, via text messages or interactive mobile apps. Because women are generally willing to use sexual assault PBS  and may increase use in response to frequent mobile assessment, interventions that reach them in the moments when they need to be used (or immediately before) may increase use during higherrisk occasions. Prevention scientists might consider supplementing efficacious individual-level interventions (e.g., MI, PNF, PBI, EAAA) with adaptive mobile components that aim to increase or maintain high levels of event-level PBS use. Event-level evaluation of PBS use following program exposure would provide valuable insight into how to structure supplemental intervention messaging, while capturing program impacts on PBS use that are not captured using more traditional longitudinal evaluation methods. Finally, practitioners and scientists alike might consider the utility of both sexual assault and drinking PBS in their prevention programs and research. Previous research shows women use more sexual assault PBS on days when they drink . This suggests sexual assault PBS may be particularly appealing and more likely to be used among drinkers. These strategies may enhance alcohol reduction programs' impact on sexual assault outcomes (e.g., . Further, sexual assault risk reduction programs are often sought out by women with prior victimization experience , who may be at increased risk for heavy drinking . Whereas most programs address alcohol as a situational risk factor, more robust discussion of drinking PBS may be useful for these women. Regardless of the setting, discussions of PBS use should be coupled with reminders that these strategies aim to reduce risk, but may not completely eliminate it. It is equally important to highlight that if women experience sexual assault even after using PBS, that does not imply the assault was their fault; sexual assault is always caused by a perpetrator. In a continued effort to shift the responsibility of sexual assault prevention away from potential victims, practitioners should implement both alcohol and sexual assault risk reduction programs in combination with efficacious programs that reduce community-level risk (e.g., bystander intervention;  and perpetration behaviors . Limitations and Future Directions Although careful controls were in place throughout the study, certain limitations remain. Our sample size was sufficient to address the proposed research questions, but findings would be strengthened from replication in a larger, more diverse sample of women who engage in different patterns of drinking (abstainers, light, moderate, and heavy). Including light and non-drinkers in future research would be beneficial considering they may still be at risk when they are in the presence of others who are drinking. Decision-making patterns also should be examined among different groups of students we know to be at increased risk for alcohol-related problems and/or sexual victimization (e.g., LGBTQ, international, racial/ethnic minority and first-generation students; those involved in Greek Life or with a history or prior victimization), as they may have unique prevention needs. Although a significant portion of our sample indicated intentions to join Greek Life, our data do not indicate who actually joined, and we were underpowered for the three-way interactions required to reliably examine group differences. Although EMA compliance was high (>90%), initial response and enrollment rates could be improved, perhaps by offering online/virtual training or higher incentives. To minimize respondent burden, the current study examined a limited set of theoretical constructs (i.e., intentions and willingness). Additional work is needed to examine contextual and intrapersonal decision-making factors (e.g., norms, attitudes, expectancies, perceived situational risk) at the event level to better understand malleable constructs that can be targeted by interventions. Further, we were unable to link PBS use to sexual assault outcomes because there was limited endorsement of unwanted sexual experiences on any of the 14 measured occasions. Although these associations are wellestablished using cross-sectional and non-diary longitudinal designs , linking PBS use and sexual assault outcomes at the event-level would uniquely inform prevention. Such a study would likely require a longer EMA data collection period (e.g., 30 days) and an event-contingent assessment method to capture outcomes tied to specific PBS use. Finally, our data were exclusively self-reported. The intrusive nature of repeated self-report data collection has been identified as a potential source of bias (e.g., reactivity to study procedures) and a threat to ecological validity . This work could be enhanced by incorporating unobtrusive data collection techniques, such as video diaries, biosensors, or geolocation data, which have the potential to eliminate self-report biases, provide robust monitoring of alcohol consumption, and add to our contextual understanding of PBS use (e.g., how decisions to use PBS are made at different levels of intoxication; whether decisions vary across social contexts or physical locations). Conclusion The current study was the first to examine event-level decisions to use both sexual assault and drinking PBS. The findings demonstrated decision-making constructs related to using sexual assault and drinking PBS among college women vary between people and at the event level, and unique intervention approaches may be needed to increase specific types of PBS. Findings from the study also highlight the need for both global and eventlevel intervention approaches to be tailored to women based on their current willingness and intentions to utilize PBS rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.

4,4,Attachment and Borderline Personality Disorder: Differential Effects on Situational Socio-Affective Processes,"Insecure attachment and borderline personality disorder (BPD) are defined by similar affective and interpersonal processes. Individuals diagnosed with BPD, however, represent only a subset of those described as insecurely attached, suggesting that attachment may hold broader relevance for socio-affective functioning. Based on a 21-day ecological momentary assessment protocol in a mixed clinical and community sample (N = 207) oversampled for BPD, we evaluate the discriminant validity of each construct as it influences daily interpersonal interactions. We find that insecure attachment is associated with elevated perceptions of interpersonal disaffiliation and maladaptive strategies for affect regulation, whereas enacted interpersonal hostility is more distinctive for BPD. In a series of sensitivity analyses, we further highlight potential caveats to these findings when studying both constructs concurrently. Together, our results suggest that both insecure attachment and BPD contribute to problematic affective and interpersonal processes, but that they do so at different stages of the unfolding social interaction, which has important implications for their maintenance and treatment.","[""Attachment"", ""Borderline personality disorder"", ""Ambulatory assessment"", ""Multilevel structural equation modeling"", ""Daily socio-affective processes""]",10.1007/s42761-020-00017-7,

The present study used a combined approach of ambulatory physiology measures and ecological momentary assessment conducted over a 4-week period to examine the extent to which emotional experience and physiology show coherence in daily life within-persons; and whether individual differences in response coherence are associated with between-person differences in well-being, negative emotionality, and gender. Results revealed that, on average, individuals exhibited coherence between subjective experience and physiology of emotion, but that there was substantial between-person variation in coherence in daily life. Exploratory analyses revealed no credible link between levels of response coherence and well-being, negative emotionality, or gender. Findings contribute to the literature by demonstrating a novel methodological approach to measuring coherence in daily life and supporting the generalizability of coherence to ecologically valid contexts.","[""Emotion coherence"", ""Emotion concordance"", ""Response coherence"", ""EMA"", ""Well-being""]",10.1016/j.biopsycho.2021.108074,
6,6,Characterizing nicotine exposure among a community sample of non-daily smokers in the United States,"Background: Over one-quarter of all smokers in the United States identify as non-daily smokers and this number is projected to rise. Unlike daily smokers who typically maintain consistent levels of nicotine exposure with regular smoking, non-daily smokers have variable patterns of smoking that likely result in high intraindividual variability in nicotine intake. The current study aimed to characterize the weekly intraindividual variability in cotinine and identify smoking-related predictors in nondaily smokers. Methods: An ecological momentary assessment of 60 non-daily smokers ages 24-57 years was conducted over a consecutive 7-day at-home protocol to log each smoking session, assessments of mood and social activity during smoking, and collection of daily saliva samples in a convenience sample from Pennsylvania, USA. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the effects of smoking characteristics on total cotinine exposure measured by pharmacokinetic area under the curve and the range, maximum, and minimum cotinine values during the week controlling for demographic variables. Results: The mean daily cotinine level was 119.2 ng/ml (SD = 168.9) with individual values that ranged from nondetectable to 949.6 ng/ml. Menthol predicted increased total cotinine levels (P < 0.05). Shorter time to the first cigarette of the day predicted significantly higher minimum (P < 0.05), maximum (P < 0.05), and total cotinine values (P < 0.05) after controlling for covariates. Negative emotions and social interactions with others were also significantly associated with higher cotinine metrics. There was no significant effect of the nicotine metabolite ratio.Conclusions: Our findings highlight the variability in nicotine exposure across days among non-daily smokers and point to the role of smoking context in nicotine exposure. The findings suggest the need to develop better assessment methods to determine health and dependence risk and personalized cessation interventions for this heterogeneous and growing group of smokers.","[""Non-daily smokers"", ""Nicotine exposure"", ""Nicotine dependence"", ""Cotinine"", ""Smoking behavior""]",10.1186/s12889-021-11052-9,
7,7,Daily variation in sleep characteristics in individuals with and without post traumatic stress disorder,"Background: Sleep disturbances are common in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, little is known about how daily variation in sleep characteristics is related to PTSD. This study examined the nightto-night and weekday versus weekend variation in sleep duration, sleep quality, trouble falling asleep, and difficulty staying asleep in individuals with and without PTSD.Methods: Participants (N = 157; 80 with PTSD, 77 without PTSD) completed daily self-reports of their nighttime sleep characteristics for 15 consecutive days. Linear mixed models were used to examine the associations between the 7 days of the week and weekday versus weekend variation in sleep characteristics and PTSD.Results: Individuals with PTSD reported shorter sleep duration, lower sleep quality, more trouble falling asleep, and more difficulty staying asleep than individuals without PTSD. The pattern of change across the week and between weekdays and weekends was different between those with and without PTSD for sleep quality and trouble falling asleep. Among those with PTSD, sleep duration, sleep quality, and trouble falling asleep differed across the 7 days of the week and showed differences between weekdays and weekends. For those without PTSD, only sleep duration differed across the 7 days of the week and showed differences between weekdays and weekends. Neither group showed 7 days of the week nor weekday versus weekend differences in difficulty staying asleep. Conclusions: On average those with PTSD had shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality, and greater trouble falling and staying asleep. In particular, the day of week variation in sleep quality and trouble falling asleep specifically distinguishes those with PTSD from those without PTSD. Our findings suggest that clinical care might be improved by assessments of sleep patterns and disturbances across at least a week, including weekdays and weekends. Future studies should explore the mechanisms related to the patterns of sleep disturbance among those with PTSD.","[""Sleep"", ""Symptom assessment"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Military personnel""]",10.1186/s12888-021-03282-3,
8,8,Do daily mood fluctuations activate ruminative thoughts as a mental habit? Results from an ecological momentary assessment study,"It has been suggested that mental habits may underpin a heightened disposition to engage in rumination in response to negative mood. The aim of the current study was to assess the role of habit in the dynamic interplay between affect and ruminative thinking in the flow of daily life experiences. Using mobile ecological momentary assessment, 97 participants recorded affect and rumination ten times daily over six days, after completing measures of trait ruminative brooding and habitual characteristics of negative thinking (e.g. automaticity, lack of conscious awareness, intent and control). Momentary fluctuations in negative (increased) and positive (decreased) affect was prospectively associated with greater rumination-levels at the next sampling occasion. The degree to which affect triggered a subsequent ruminative response was moderated by habitual characteristics of negative thinking in a theoretically consistent way. Stronger temporal pairing of negative affect and rumination was also associated with greater emotional inertia but less carry-over of rumination from one moment to the next. Depression vulnerability may be in the form of rumination being habitually triggered in response to momentary fluctuations in affect, with deleterious effect on mood. The findings may have clinical implications, as targeting the habitual nature of rumination might help reduce depression vulnerability.","[""Depression"", ""Rumination"", ""Habit"", ""Ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1016/j.brat.2021.103832,
9,9,"Effort, avolition and motivational experience in schizophrenia: Analysis of behavioral and neuroimaging data with relationships to daily motivational experience","Recent research suggests that schizophrenia is associated with reduced effort allocation. We examined willingness to expend effort, neural correlates of effort allocation, and the relationship of effort to daily motivational experience in schizophrenia. We recruited 28 individuals with schizophrenia and 30 controls to perform an effort task during fMRI. Individuals with schizophrenia also completed an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol. Individuals with schizophrenia with high negative symptoms were less willing to expend effort for rewards. Daily EMA assessments of motivation were positively associated with effort allocation at a trendlevel. Individuals with schizophrenia and controls displayed similar increases in BOLD activation in frontal, cingulate, parietal, and insular regions during effort-based decision-making. However, negative symptoms were associated with reduced BOLD activation in bilateral ventral striatum. These results replicate previous reports of reduced effort allocation in schizophrenia patients with severe negative symptoms, and provide evidence for the role of ventral striatum in effort impairments.","[""affective neuroscience"", ""cognitive neuroscience"", ""decision making"", ""neuroimaging"", ""schizophrenia""]",10.1177/2167702620901558,
10,10,Ecological Momentary Assessment of the Relationship between Positive Outcome Expectancies and Gambling Behaviour,"Relapse prevention models suggest that positive outcome expectancies can constitute situa-tional determinants of relapse episodes that interact with other factors to determine the likelihoodof relapse. The primary aims were to examine reciprocal relationships between situational positivegambling outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour and moderators of these relationships. Anonline survey and a 28 day Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) were administered to 109past-month gamblers (84% with gambling problems). EMA measures included outcome expectan-cies (enjoyment/arousal, self-enhancement, money), self-efficacy, craving, negative emotional state,interpersonal conflict, social pressure, positive emotional state, financial pressures, and gamblingbehaviour (episodes, expenditure). Pre-EMA measures included problem gambling severity, motives,psychological distress, coping strategies, and outcome expectancies.  No reciprocal relationshipsbetween EMA outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour (episodes, expenditure) were iden-tified.  Moderations predicting gambling episodes revealed:  (1) cravings and problem gamblingexacerbated effects of enjoyment/arousal expectancies; (2) positive emotional state and positivereframing coping exacerbated effects of self-enhancement expectancies; and (3) instrumental socialsupport buffered effects of money expectancies. Positive outcome expectancies therefore constitutesituational determinants of gambling behaviour, but only when they interact with other factors. Allpre-EMA expectancies predicted problem gambling severity (OR = 1.61_3.25). Real-time interventionsaddressing gambling outcome expectancies tailored to vulnerable gamblers are required.

Participants were 60 university students with a history of repetitive NSSI. At baseline, participants completed an emotional stop-signal task assessing response inhibition to self-harm stimuli. Participants subsequently completed an ecological momentary assessment protocol in which they reported negative affect, urgency, and NSSI urge intensity three times daily over a ten-day period. Impaired emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli did not evidence a main effect on the strength of momentary NSSI urges. However, emotional response inhibition to self-harm images interacted with momentary negative affect to predict the strength of real-time NSSI urges, after adjusting for emotional response inhibition to neutral images. Our findings suggest that emotional response inhibition deficits specifically to self-harm stimuli may pose vulnerability for increased NSSI urge intensity during real-time, state-level negative affect.","[""Nonsuicidal self-injury"", ""Inhibitory control"", ""Emotional stop-signal task"", ""Urgency"", ""Negative affect"", ""Ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1016/j.brat.2021.103865,
12,12,How adolescents' working memory abilities relate to their alcohol craving in real-life contexts depends on biological sex,"We sought to elucidate whether stress, peers, and in vivo (i.e., direct) alcohol cues elicit alcohol craving in daily life among adolescents and to test whether individual variation in working memory function and biological sex alters these associations. Methods: We leveraged ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine momentary associations between stress, peers, and direct alcohol cues with craving, assessed as ""urge to drink alcohol,"" among 86 male (51.2 %) and female (48.8 %) frequent drinkers (i.e., two or more drinking days per week). Participants were ages 14-24 years (M = 20.7 years, SD = 2.1). Participants completed EMA throughout the day for about one week prior to randomization to a treatment condition for an AUD clinical trial. Pre-registered, secondary analyses focused on craving for assessments when adolescents were not drinking, and assessments occurring after drinking on drinking days were removed. Working memory performance was assessed in the laboratory via the Memory for Words subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Cognitive Abilities. Results: Craving was heightened at more stressful moments and when adolescents were with their peers and in the presence of direct alcohol cues. Working memory function was not related to craving but altered the relation of momentary stress, peers, and cues with craving once biological sex-related differences were considered. Females generally had lower craving than males, but working memory function served to buffer against stressinduced craving for males. Conclusions: Higher working memory function buffered the in-the-moment relation of stress with alcohol craving for males but not females.","[""Stress"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Alcohol"", ""Adolescents"", ""Craving""]",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108642,
13,13,How Task-Unrelated and Freely Moving Thought Relate to Affect: Evidence for Dissociable Patterns in Everyday Life,"Much of our knowledge about the correlates of mind-wandering comes from assessing task-unrelated thought. Less is known about the correlates of freely moving thought, a dimension that assesses the degree to which thoughts arise and unfold with low levels of guidance or constraints. Task-unrelated thought is consistently associated with more negative affective valence compared with being on task; however, it is unclear whether freely moving thought shares the same relationship with affect. We conducted two ecological momentary assessment studies in the context of everyday life and found that the two dimensions have different affective correlates. In Study 1, task-unrelated thought was associated with less positive concurrent valence than being on-task. However, freely moving thought was associated with more positive concurrent valence and was predictive of more positive valence at a subsequent timepoint. Freely moving thought, but not task-unrelated thought, also positively predicted concurrent arousal. Computational sentiment analyses of participants' thought descriptions offered convergent evidence of differential relationships between the two thought dimensions and affect. Study 2 used different measurement scales to assess whether (a) the pattern of findings replicated and (b) if the effects were robust to changes in measurement. The main findings were replicated: task-unrelated thought was negatively associated with concurrent valence, whereas freely moving thought was positively associated with concurrent valence. However, freely moving thought did not predict subsequent valence and was not related to concurrent arousal. The most robust findings related to concurrent valence. Although mindwandering has acquired a relatively negative reputation to date, our findings suggest that there might be positive aspects that remain unexplored.","[""mind-wandering"", ""affect"", ""task-unrelated thought"", ""freely moving thought"", ""valence""]",10.1037/emo0000849,

The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was used to assess self-reported childhoodtrauma. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, 1- and 2-year follow-up.Results.The association of stress with positive (¦Â=_0.14,p= 0.010) and negative affect (¦Â=0.11,p= 0.020) was modified by transition status such that stress reactivity was greater in indi-viduals who transitioned to psychosis. Moreover, the association of stress with negative affect(¦Â= 0.06,p= 0.019) and psychotic experiences (¦Â= 0.05,p= 0.037) was greater in individualsexposed to highv. low levels of childhood trauma. We also found evidence that decreasedpositive affect in response to stress was associated with reduced functioning at 1-year fol-low-up (B= 6.29,p= 0.034). In addition, there was evidence that the association of childhoodtrauma with poor functional outcomes was mediated by stress reactivity (e.g. indirect effect:B=_2.13,p= 0.026), but no evidence that stress reactivity mediated the association betweenchildhood trauma and transition (e.g. indirect effect:B= 0.14,p= 0.506).Conclusions.Emotional and psychotic stress reactivity may be potential mechanisms linkingchildhood trauma with clinical outcomes in UHR individuals.","[""at-risk mental state"", ""childhood abuse"", ""transition"", ""stress sensitization"", ""ecologicalmomentary assessment"", ""EMA"", ""experience sampling method"", ""ESM""]",10.1017/S2045796021000251,
15,15,Impact of self-efficacy on daily intention to not smoke,"Background: To improve cessation interventions, it is necessary to understand the factors associated with daily motivation to not smoke. One hypothesized factor is self-efficacy; however, there has been a lack of evidence investigating self-efficacy as a dynamic construct. Methods: This study examined the influence of baseline and daily self-efficacy on setting daily abstinence plans in pre-quit smokers and successful plans. Participants (N = 76) completed measures of self-efficacy at baseline, and each evening during 28 days of ecological momentary assessment. Results: Baseline self-efficacy was not correlated with mean daily rating of self-efficacy or variance in ratings. GLMM found that participants who had higher baseline self-efficacy than others were more likely to set an abstinence plan while participants who had a higher rating of self-efficacy on the previous night than others were more likely to set a plan on any given morning. Participants were less likely to set an abstinence plan if they had smoked on the previous day but were more likely if they had set an abstinence plan on the previous day. Participants were less likely to have a successful plan not to smoke if they smoked on the previous day. Conclusions: The current data indicates that both baseline rating and day-to-day fluctuations in SE influence daily abstinence plan in pre-quit smokers. Future intervention research could examine the use of methods designed to increase and maintain a person's daily self-efficacy and how this can be leveraged to encourage these smokers to attempt long-term cessation.","[""Self-efficacy"", ""Smoking"", ""Ecological Momentary Assessment"", ""Abstinence""]",10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.106877,

However, operationalization and therefore induction of rumination in experimental settings poses a major challenge in terms of ecological validity. As stress seems to play a key role in everyday situations eliciting rumination, we conducted two stress paradigms while assessing behavioral and neurophysiological measures.Aiming to replicate previous findings on induced rumination by means of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and comparing them to physiological (pain) stress, a clinical sample of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; n = 22) and healthy controls (HC; n = 23) was recruited. Cortical blood oxygenation was assessed during the stress paradigms using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Further, we used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of stress, rumination and mood to be able to correlate ruminative responses during induced stress and everyday rumination.Our results showed that social stress but not physiological stress induced depressive rumination in MDD but not in HC. Further, rumination reactivity in response to social stress but not to physiological stress was significantly associated with rumination reactivity in everyday life as assessed with EMA. With respect to cortical oxygenation, MDD subjects showed hypoactivity in the Cognitive Control Network during the TSST, which mediated the differences between MDD and HC in post-stress rumination.Our findings emphasize the role of negative social triggers in depressive rumination and validate the TSST as an induction method for depressive rumination.

Whereas sleep duration is influenced by a broad range of behavioural, environmental, and physiological factors (Irish et al., 2015; Klerman & Dijk, 2005), the amount of time allowed for sleep at night (i.e. sleep opportunity) is more directly within behavioural control, and therefore represents an important target for sleep health promotion efforts.

19,19,"Mental Health and Behavior of College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Mobile Smartphone and Ecological Momentary Assessment Study, Part II","Background: Since late 2019, the lives of people across the globe have been disrupted by COVID-19. Millions of people have become infected with the disease, while billions of people have been continually asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that it is associated with large-scale behavioral and mental health changes; however, few studies have been able to track these changes with frequent, near real-time sampling or compare these changes to previous years of data for the same individuals.Objective: By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data in a cohort of college-aged students enrolled in a longitudinal study, we seek to understand the behavioral and mental health impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, measured by interest across the United States in the search terms coronavirus and COVID fatigue.Methods: Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone use, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife mobile smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Spring 2020 term, as compared to previous terms in the same cohort, were modeled using mixed linear models.Results: Linear mixed models demonstrated differences in phone use, sleep, sedentary time and number of locations visited associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In further models, these behaviors were strongly associated with increased interest in COVID fatigue. When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, phone use, sedentary time), both anxiety and depression (P<.001) were significantly associated with interest in COVID fatigue. Notably, these behavioral and mental health changes are consistent with those observed around the initial implementation of COVID-19 lockdowns in the spring of 2020. Conclusions: In the initial lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, people spent more time on their phones, were moresedentary, visited fewer locations, and exhibited increased symptoms of anxiety and depression. As the pandemic persisted throughthe spring, people continued to exhibit very similar changes in both mental health and behaviors. Although these large-scale shiftsin mental health and behaviors are unsurprising, understanding them is critical in disrupting the negative consequences to mentalhealth during the ongoing pandemic.

20,20,mHealth-Assisted Detection of Precursors to Relapse in Schizophrenia,"Theoretical views and a growing body of empirical evidence suggest that psychiatric relapses in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSDs) have measurable warning signs. However, because they are time-and resource-intensive, existing assessment approaches are not well-suited to detect these warning signs in a timely, scalable fashion. Mobile technologies deploying frequent measurements-i.e., ecological momentary assessment-could be leveraged to detect increases in symptoms that may precede relapses. The present study examined EMA measurements with growth curve models in the 100 days preceding and following 27 relapses (among n = 20 individuals with SSDs) to identify (1) what symptoms changed in the periods gradually preceding, following, and right as relapses occur, (2) how large were these changes, and (3) on what time scale did they occur. Results demonstrated that, on average, participants reported elevations in negative mood (d = 0.34), anxiety (d =0.49), persecutory ideation (d =0.35), and hallucinations (d =0.34) on relapse days relative to their average during the study. These increases emerged gradually on average from significant and steady increases (d = 0.05 per week) in persecutory ideation and hallucinations over the 100-day period preceding relapse. This suggests that brief (i.e., 1-2 item) assessments of psychotic symptoms may detect meaningful signals that precede psychiatric relapses long before they occur. These assessments could increase opportunities for relapse prevention as remote measurement-based care management platforms develop.","[""technology"", ""mobile health"", ""schizophrenia"", ""relapse"", ""ecological momentary assessment""]",10.3389/fpsyt.2021.642200,
21,21,Neurobiological and Psychological Maintenance Mechanisms Associated with Anticipatory Reward in Bulimia Nervosa,"The purpose of this investigation is to identify the anticipatory reward mechanisms that maintain binge eating and purging in bulimia nervosa. Emerging data indicate the importance of reward and anticipatory processes as maintenance mechanisms of bulimia nervosa that can be targeted in treatment. The proposed research will identify neurobiological and psychological anticipatory mechanisms of binge eating and purging using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in the natural environment. In this investigation, 60 adults (30 with bulimia nervosa and 30 matched comparison participants) will undergo negative and positive mood inductions followed by an fMRI food selection task (and a comparison shopping task) to examine neurobiological and affective responses to food and non-food reward anticipation. Participants with bulimia nervosa will complete two weeks of EMA examining realtime affect changes in relation to the anticipation of binge eating and purging. These methods will facilitate rigorous assessment of the links between neurobiological (fMRI) and naturalistic (EMA) data in anticipatory reward processes. Findings from this investigation will inform the conceptualization and treatment of bulimia nervosa by identifying the role of reward anticipation in symptom maintenance, providing a crucial framework for targeting these anticipatory processes in existing and novel interventions.","[""bulimia nervosa"", ""fMRI"", ""EMA""]",10.20900/jpbs.20210005,

In this study we explored the wish to die and other suicide risk factors using smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in patients with a history of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. Contrary to our expectations we found a decrease in the wish to die during lockdown. This is consistent with previous studies showing that suicide rates decrease during periods of social emergency.

23,23,Perseverative Cognition in the Positive Valence Systems: An Experimental and Ecological Investigation,"Perseverative cognition (PC) is a transdiagnostic risk factor that characterizes both hypo-motivational (e.g., depression) and hyper-motivational (e.g., addiction) disorders; however, it hasbeen almost exclusively studied within the context of the negative valence systems. The present studyaimed to fill this gap by combining laboratory-based, computational and ecological assessments.Healthy individuals performed the Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT) before and after the inductionof PC or a waiting period. Computational modeling was applied to dissociate the effects of PC onreward sensitivity and learning rate.  Afterwards, participants underwent a one-week ecologicalmomentary assessment of daily PC occurrence, as well as anticipatory and consummatory reward-related behavior. Induction of PC led to increased response bias on the PRT compared to waiting,likely due to an increase in learning rate but not in reward sensitivity, as suggested by computationalmodeling. In daily-life, PC increased the discrepancy between expected and obtained rewards (i.e.,prediction error).  Current converging experimental and ecological evidence suggests that PC isassociated with abnormalities in the functionality of positive valence systems. Given the role of PCin the prediction, maintenance, and recurrence of psychopathology, it would be clinically valuable toextend research on this topic beyond the negative valence systems.

24,24,"Predictors of unplanned drinking in daily life: The influence of context, impulsivity, and craving in those with emotion dysregulation","Objective: Unplanned drinking, or drinking that violates intentions, has been linked to significant alcohol-related consequences; however, little is known about what factors within individuals daily lives predict whether un-planned drinking occurs. This  study examines the  influence of daily-life impulsivity, alcohol craving, and interpersonal contexts on unplanned drinking. Method: Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data were collected from 32 moderate drinkers. Participants were prompted six times per day for up to 21 days. Each morning participants reported whether they planned to drink that day. Multilevel and GEE models predicted drinking behaviors on days without intent to drink from daily-life interpersonal contexts, and pre-drinking ratings of impulsivity and craving. Results: Spending time in a bar and spending relatively more time with other people on days with no intention to drink was associated with drinking. Individuals who experienced higher craving prior to drinking were relatively more likely to engage in unplanned drinking. When participants reported relatively greater difficulties with premeditation, they were more likely to subsequently report initiating an unplanned drinking episode. Results also suggest that individuals generally higher on negative urgency may be less likely to engage in unplanned drinking but drink more when they do. Conclusion: These results indicate the influence of daily-life contexts, craving, and impulsivity on unplanned drinking behavior. We highlight several possible avenues for intervention and prevention efforts including modifying social and interpersonal environments, screening for craving patterns, and targeting cognitive deficits in planning.","[""Alcohol"", ""Unplanned drinking"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Craving"", ""Contexts""]",10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.106901,
25,25,Quality versus quantity: Determining real-world social functioning deficits in schizophrenia,"Social dysfunction is a hallmark of schizophrenia that is associated with emotional disturbances. Researchers have employed ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to measure social and emotional functioning in people with schizophrenia. Yet, few studies have evaluated quality of real-world social interactions, and it is unclear how interactions impact emotional experiences in this population. Using novel EMA that passively collects audio data, we examined daily social behavior and emotion in schizophrenia (n = 38) and control (n = 36) groups. Contrary to hypotheses, both groups interacted with others at the same rate and exhibited similar levels of positive emotion. However, as expected, the schizophrenia group exhibited significantly less high-quality interactions and reported more negative emotion than controls. Social versus non-social context did not influence experienced emotion in either group. This is the first real-world study to passively assess quality of social interactions in schizophrenia. Although those with schizophrenia did not differ in their number of interactions, they were less likely to engage in substantive, personal conversations. Because high-quality interactions are linked with better social outcomes, this finding has important potential treatment implications. Future research should investigate quality of interactions across different types of social activities to gain a more nuanced understanding of social dysfunction in schizophrenia.","[""Schizophrenia"", ""Social functioning"", ""Emotion"", ""Ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113980,
26,26,"Racial Discrimination, Sedentary Time, and Physical Activity in African Americans: Quantitative Study Combining Ecological Momentary Assessment and Accelerometers","Background: A growing number of studies indicate that exposure to social stress, such as perceived racial discrimination, may contribute to poor health, health behaviors, and health disparities. Increased physical activity (PA) may buffer the impact of social stress resulting from racial discrimination. However, to date, data on the relationship between racial discrimination and PA have been mixed. Part of the reason is that the effect of perceived racial discrimination on PA has primarily been examined in cross-sectional studies that captured retrospective measures of perceived racial discrimination associated with individuals' current PA outcomes. The association between real-time perceived racial discrimination and PA among African Americans remains unclear.Objective: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship among demographic, anthropometric and clinical, and psychological factors with lifetime racial discrimination and examine the within-and between-person associations between daily real-time racial discrimination and PA outcomes (total energy expenditure, sedentary time, and moderate-to-vigorous PA patterns) measured by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and accelerometers in healthy African Americans.Methods: This pilot study used an intensive, observational, case-crossover design of African Americans (n=12) recruited from the community. After participants completed baseline surveys, they were asked to wear an accelerometer for 7 days to measure their PA levels. EMA was sent to participants 5 times per day for 7 days to assess daily real-time racial discrimination. Multilevel models were used to examine the within-and between-person associations of daily racial discrimination on PA.Results: More EMA-reported daily racial discrimination was associated with younger age (r=0.75; P=.02). Daily EMA-reported microaggression was associated with depressive symptoms (r=0.66; P=.05), past race-related events (r=0.82; P=.004), and lifetime discrimination (r=0.78; P=.01). In the within-person analyses, the day-level association of racial discrimination and sedentary time was significant (Î²=.30, SE 0.14; P=.03), indicating that on occasions when participants reported more racial discrimination than usual, more sedentary time was observed. Between-person associations of racial discrimination  SE 0.28; P=.29)   or microaggression  SE 0.36; P=.34)  with total energy expenditure were suggestive but inconclusive.Conclusions: Concurrent use of EMA and accelerometers is a feasible method to examine the relationship between racial discrimination and PA in real time. Examining daily processes at the within-person level has the potential to elucidate the mechanisms of which racial discrimination may have on health and health behaviors and to guide the development of personalized interventions for increasing PA in racial ethnic minorities. Future studies with a precision health approach, incorporating withinand between-person associations, are warranted to further elucidate the effects of racial discrimination and PA.","[""racial discrimination"", ""physical activity"", ""ecological momentary assessment"", ""African American"", ""pilot study"", ""mobile phone""]",10.2196/25687,
27,27,Real-Life Self-Control is Predicted by Parietal Activity During Preference Decision Making: A Brain Decoding Analysis,"Despite its relevance for health and education, the neurocognitive mechanism of real-life self-control is largely unknown. While recent research revealed a prominent role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the computation of an integrative value signal, the contribution and relevance of other brain regions for real-life self-control remains unclear. To investigate neural correlates of decisions in line with long-term consequences and to assess the potential of brain decoding methods for the individual prediction of real-life self-control, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging during preference decision making with ecological momentary assessment of daily self-control in a large community sample (N = 266). Decisions in line with long-term consequences were associated with increased activity in bilateral angular gyrus and precuneus, regions involved in different forms of perspective taking, such as imagining one's own future and the perspective of others. Applying multivariate pattern analysis to the same clusters revealed that individual patterns of activity predicted the probability of real-life self-control. Brain activations are discussed in relation to episodic future thinking and mentalizing as potential mechanisms mediating real-life self-control.","[""Self-control"", ""Value-based decision making"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Ecological validity"", ""Brain decoding""]",10.3758/s13415-021-00913-w,
28,28,Real-time associations between discrimination and anxious and depressed mood among sexual and gender minorities: The moderating effects of lifetime victimization and identity concealment,"Background: Sexual and gender minorities (SGM) experience higher rates of depression and anxiety, which are linked to higher rates of discrimination and victimization. SGM individuals may conceal their SGM identities to decrease discrimination and victimization exposure; however, these experiences still occur, and concealment itself is often associated with greater anxiety and depression. However, it remains unclear whether lifetime victimization and identity concealment moderate the effect of day-to-day discrimination, which we evaluated in the current study using ecological momentary assessment (EMA).Methods: Fifty SGM participants (Mage=21.82, SD=4.70; 84% White) completed baseline assessment (e.g., concealment and lifetime victimization) followed by EMA of daily discrimination and anxious and depressed mood for 14 days.Results: As hypothesized, daily discrimination predicted momentary increases in anxious and depressed mood, b = .34, p < .001. Notably, these effects were more pronounced among individuals who reported higher levels of identity concealment, b = .25, p < .001, and previous SGM-based victimization experiences (marginally), b = .18, p = .05. Main effects of cumulative lifetime victimization and identity concealment, measured at baseline, were associated with higher ratings of anxious and depressed mood over the two-week study.Discussion: While identity concealment may reduce exposure to discrimination and victimization, we found that concealment and prior victimization predict heightened reactivity to daily discrimination experiences. Additional research is needed to further explicate real-time effects of minority stress exposure, and to develop interventions that may mitigate risk among SGM individuals with prior victimization exposure and higher levels of identity concealment in particular.","[""LGBT"", ""minority stress"", ""depression"", ""anxiety"", ""ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1037/sgd0000371,
29,29,Savoring the present: The reciprocal influence between positive emotions and positive emotion regulation in everyday life,"A growing body of research has investigated the regulation of negative emotions in ecological settings, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying positive emotion regulation in everyday life. Although some evidence suggests that adopting positive strategies is beneficial for emotional well-being, the literature is inconsistent about the effects of positive emotions on subsequent regulatory processes. In the present study, we adopted a two-week ecological momentary assessment to explore the association between positive emotions and positive emotion regulation in daily life. According to our results, the less individuals felt positive emotions at one point, the more they tended to enhance their use of positive strategies from this time to the next, which in turn resulted in subsequent higher levels of positive emotions. This prototype of positive regulation can be seen as a highly adaptive mechanism that makes it possible to compensate for a lack of positive emotions by enhancing the deployment of positive strategies. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","[""Emotions"", ""Mental health and psychiatry"", ""Cognition"", ""Happiness"", ""Attention"", ""Cognitive psychology"", ""Ecology"", ""Undergraduates""]",10.1371/journal.pone.0251561,
30,30,Self-Critical and Self-Punishment Cognitions Differentiate Those With and Without a History of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury: An Ecological Momentary Assessment Study,"The aim of this study was to examine trait, state, and temporal instability measures of self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions to evaluate their respective roles in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Participants were university students with a history of NSSI (n = 64) and those with no history of NSSI (n = 59). At baseline, participants completed measures assessing history of NSSI behavior, as well as trait measures of self-criticism and self-punishment. After com-pletion of baseline procedures, participants subsequently participated in a 10-day ecological momentary assessment protocol in which self-critical and self-punishment cognitions were assessed in real time three times daily. Employing bivariate and multivariate frameworks, our results demonstrate that both trait and state levels of self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions robustly differentiate between young adults with and without a lifetime history of NSSI. The present results also confirm that the temporal instability of these cognitive states also meaningfully differentiate between groups, such that those who exhibit greater fluctuations in these cognitive states are more likely to have a history of NSSI. The current findings suggest that trait, state, and temporal instability of negative self-focused cognitions may be vulnerability factors for engagement in NSSI.","[""nonsuicidal self-injury"", ""self-criticism"", ""self-punishment"", ""ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1016/j.beth.2020.08.006,

Methods: Using ecological momentary assessments to capture moments of binge drinking, marijuana use, nicotine use, and prescription misuse in everyday life, this study explored the romantic relationship contexts (status, quality, partner presence) of substance use among young adults (aged 18-21) attending a university in the Midwestern U.S. Between 2017 and 2019, 296 participants, who had endorsed recent substance use at screening for a larger study on prescription misuse, completed four reports per day for approximately 28 days, resulting in over 23,000 reports for this investigation. Results: Relationship status, partner support, and partner presence in the moment were all associated with at least one type of substance use behavior. Generalized multilevel models indicated that partnered participants engaged in less marijuana use, nicotine use, and prescription misuse in daily life compared to single participants. Higher partner support predicted less binge drinking, yet also predicted higher nicotine use and prescription misuse. When with a romantic partner in daily life, partnered participants were more likely to engage in binge drinking and marijuana use, and less likely to misuse prescription drugs. Nicotine use was more likely when with a partner, but only if partner support was high. Conclusions: Findings highlight the intricate links between interpersonal contexts and substance behaviors and indicate supportive relationships are not universally protective against substance use among this population.","[""College students"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Health behaviors"", ""Relationship quality"", ""Romantic relationships"", ""Substance use"", ""United States"", ""Young adults""]",10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114021,
33,33,The association between history of prenatal loss and maternal psychological state in a subsequent pregnancy: an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study,"Background.Prenatal loss which occurs in approximately 20% of pregnancies representsa well-established risk factor for anxiety and affective disorders. In the current study, we exam-ined whether a history of prenatal loss is associated with a subsequent pregnancy with mater-nal psychological state using ecological momentary assessment (EMA)-based measures ofpregnancy-specific distress and mood in everyday life.Method.This study was conducted in a cohort ofN= 155 healthy pregnant women, of whichN= 40 had a history of prenatal loss. An EMA protocol was used in early and late pregnancyto collect repeated measures of maternal stress and mood, on average eight times per day overa consecutive 4-day period. The association between a history of prenatal loss and psycho-logical state was estimated using linear mixed models.Results.Compared to women who had not experienced a prior prenatal loss, women with ahistory of prenatal loss reported higher levels of pregnancy-specific distress in early as well aslate pregnancy and also were more nervous and tired. Furthermore, in the comparison grouppregnancy-specific distress decreased and mood improved from early to late pregnancy,whereas these changes across pregnancy were not evident in women in the prenatal loss group.Conclusion.Our findings suggest that prenatal loss in a prior pregnancy is associated with asubsequent pregnancy with significantly higher stress and impaired mood levels in everydaylife across gestation. These findings have important implications for designing EMA-based ambu-latory, personalized interventions to reduce stress during pregnancy in this high-risk group.

34,34,"Stress, alcohol use, and punitive parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Emerging research suggests that parents are experiencing heightened stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parental stress is a risk factor for harsh or punitive parenting, and this association may be exacerbated by the use of alcohol. Objective: We examine whether parental stress is associated with use of punitive parenting, as well as whether this association is modified by drinking pattern. Participants & setting: We used advertisements and word-of-mouth to recruit 342 parents living in Central Ohio during the initial stay-at-home order for COVID-19. Methods: We used geographic ecological momentary assessment (gEMA) to measure parental stress and punitive parenting during three time periods (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.) over a period of fourteen days using an app downloaded to their cellular telephone. Participants also completed a longer baseline survey. We used nested multilevel ordinal regression models, where at-themoment assessments (Level 1) were nested within individuals (Level 2) to analyze data. Results: Higher levels of parental stress [OR = 1.149 (95 % CI = 1.123, 1.176)] and later time of day [OR = 1.255 (95 % CI = 1.146, 1.373)] were positively related to odds of punitive parenting. Drinking pattern was not significantly related to punitive parenting in models with demographic covariates. Parents who drank alcohol both monthly and weekly and had higher levels of stress had greater odds of punitive parenting than parents with high levels of stress who abstain from alcohol. Conclusions: Alcohol may be an accelerant in the use of punitive parenting for parents experiencing stress. As alcohol use increases during COVID-19, children may be at higher risk for punitive parenting.","[""Child maltreatment"", ""Alcohol use"", ""Stress"", ""COVID-19"", ""Survey research""]",10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105090,
35,35,The costs of over-control in anorexia nervosa: evidence from fMRI and ecological momentary assessment,"A growing body of evidence suggests that a high level of self-control may, despite its positive effects, influence cognitive processing in an unfavorable manner. However, the affective costs of self-control have only rarely been investigated. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder that is often characterized by excessive self-control. Here, we used fMRI to explore whether over-control in AN may have negative affective consequences. 36 predominantly adolescent female AN patients and 36 age-matched healthy controls (HC) viewed negative and neutral pictures during two separate fMRI sessions before and after 10 min of rest. We tested whether abnormally elevated neural activity during the initial presentation in a brain region broadly implicated in top-down control, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), could predict subsequent activation in limbic areas relevant to bottom-up affective processing. Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), we also tested for associations between the aforementioned neuroimaging markers and negative affective states in the two weeks following the experiment. fMRI data revealed that higher initial activation of the dlPFC in AN predicted increased amygdala reactivity during the second fMRI session, which in turn was related to increased self-reported tension during two weeks following the scan. These data suggest that overcontrol in AN patients may come at a cost including negative affective states on a short (minutes) as well as a longer time scale (days). This mechanism may significantly contribute to the persistence of AN.",,10.1038/s41398-021-01405-8,
36,36,The Error-Related Negativity Predicts Self-Control Failures in Daily Life,"Adaptive behavior critically depends on performance monitoring (PM), the ability to monitor action outcomes and the need to adapt behavior. PM-related brain activity has been linked to guiding decisions about whether action adaptation is warranted. The present study examined whether PM-related brain activity in a flanker task, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), was associated with adaptive behavior in daily life. Specifically, we were interested in the employment of self-control, operationalized as self-control failures (SCFs), and measured using ecological momentary assessment. Analyses were conducted using an adaptive elastic net regression to predict SCFs from EEG in a sample of 131 participants. The model was fit using within-subject averaged response-locked EEG activity at each electrode and time point within an epoch surrounding the response. We found that higher amplitudes of the error-related negativity (ERN) were related to fewer SCFs. This suggests that lower error-related activity may relate to lower recruitment of interventive self-control in daily life. Altered cognitive control processes, like PM, have been proposed as underlying mechanisms for various mental disorders. Understanding how alterations in PM relate to regulatory control might therefore aid in delineating how these alterations contribute to different psychopathologies.","[""performance monitoring"", ""ERN"", ""error processing"", ""EEG"", ""self-control"", ""ecological momentary assessment"", ""daily life""]",10.3389/fnhum.2020.614979,

38,38,Understanding at-the-moment stress for parents during COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions,"In spring 2020, many states in the United States enacted stay-at-home orders to limit the spread of COVID-19 and lessen effects on hospitals and health care workers. This required parents to act in new roles without much support. Although studies have asked parents about stress before and during the pandemic, none have examined how stress may have fluctuated throughout the day and the characteristics related to those daily changes.Objective: Our study assesses how time-varying (e.g., presence of a focal child) and day-varying (e.g., weekend vs. weekday) factors were related to parents' level of stress. Methods: We use Ecological Momentary Assessment to examine stress three times a day (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p. m.) for 14 days. We include two different dates hypothesized to be related to parents' stress levels: (1) when Ohio announced schools would go virtual for the rest of the academic year and (2) when most retail businesses were allowed to re-open. Our sample of 332 individuals, recruited via Facebook, Craigslist, and word of mouth, completed 13,360 of these brief surveys during April-May 2020. Data were analyzed using generalized ordered logit models. Results: Parents report lower levels of stress when completing the 9 p.m. survey, but higher levels when they were at work, during weekdays (compared to weekends) or when they were with the focal child. COVID-19 milestone dates were not related to stress levels. Conclusions: Parents need some form of respite (e.g. child care, child-only activities) to reduce stress, especially during the week when parents are juggling their outside employment and their child(ren)'s schooling. Providing parents with skills and tools to identify and reduce stress, such as apps monitoring heart rate or providing deep breathing techniques, may be one way of helping parents cope with extremely stressful situations.","[""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Stress"", ""Parents"", ""COVID-19"", ""Generalized ordered logit models""]",10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114025,
39,39,Use of Ecological Momentary Assessment to Study Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior: a Systematic Review,"Purpose of Review Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a recently introduced approach to patient evaluation that consists of asking patients questions in real time and in their usual habitat. This method seeks to contribute to suicide prevention by providing psychiatrists with detailed information about suicidal thoughts and behavior, how these fluctuate over short periods of time, and the short-term risk factors presented by patients. We conducted a systematic review of published research using EMA to study suicidal thoughts and behavior. Recent Findings Several systematic reviews of EMA in mental health have been conducted to date, and the literature contains numerous theoretical papers and compilations on EMA and suicide phenomena. To date, however, no systematic reviews have explored the use of this tool to study suicidal thoughts and behavior. Summary We performed a systematic review of five databases (i.e., PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) to identify studies on EMA and suicidal thoughts and behavior. An initial search revealed 544 articles. Following the study selection process, 35 studies were included in the review. Almost three-quarters of the studies were published in the last 4 years. The studies reviewed concluded that EMA was generally feasible and well accepted. EMA findings correlated well with the results of a retrospective assessment, though tended to over-represent symptom severity. Our review points to important aspects of suicidal thoughts and behavior, such as its wide fluctuation over short periods of time. Negative affect and disturbed sleep, among others, emerged as short-term predictors of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Therefore, EMA is a potentially useful tool in clinical practice, although not without drawbacks, such as participant fatigue with questionnaires and ethical concerns.","[""Suicide"", ""Suicide attempt"", ""Suicidal ideation"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Mobile health""]",10.1007/s11920-021-01255-7,
