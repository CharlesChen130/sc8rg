0,0,Ecological momentary assessment of interpersonal theory of suicide constructs in people experiencing psychotic symptoms,"Background: People with psychotic disorders are at an increased risk of suicide, but there is little understanding of suicidal ideation (SI) in this population. The Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide posits that perceived burdensomeness (PB) and thwarted belonginess (TB) contribute to SI. To our knowledge there are no studies using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to assess these interpersonal risk factors in a sample of individuals with psychotic disorders. This study investigated the validity and variability of PB and TB, and whether SI, EMAmeasured psychotic symptoms, mood, and social context relate to PB and TB. Method: Ninety-six participants with a psychotic disorder, including mood disorders with psychosis completed inlab assessments of current SI, and then EMA surveys on a smartphone 3/day for 10 days, answering questions about burdensomeness, belongingness, symptoms (i.e., hearing voices, experiencing suspiciousness), mood (i.e., happy, sad), and social context. Results: Burdensomeness varied within-participants less than belongingness (t (95) = -3.74, p=< .001). Participants with SI had higher mean burdensomeness ratings (t (94) = -2.70, p < .01) and lower mean belongingness ratings (t (94) = 3.68, p < .001) than did participants without SI. Being with others, greater psychotic experiences, less happiness, and greater sadness related to greater burdensomeness. SI status, being alone, greater psychotic experiences, less happiness, and greater sadness related to less belongingness. Conclusions: This study examined the real-time influences of SI and psychotic symptoms on burdensomeness and belongingness. Hearing voices, suspiciousness, mood, and SI are related to interpersonal suicide-related risk factors. In this sample, social context had a differential effect on burdensomeness and belongingness.","[""Schizophrenia"", ""Schizoaffective disorder"", ""Bipolar disorder"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""EMA"", ""Suicide"", ""Psychosis""]",10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.06.022,
1,1,The after-effects of momentary suicidal ideation: A preliminary examination of emotion intensity changes following suicidal thoughts,"Research using ecological momentary assessments has highlighted the importance of negative emotions as predictors of day-to-day suicidal thoughts. Yet only one study has examined the real-time consequences of these thoughts. This preliminary investigation examined changes in emotion intensity following suicidal thoughts. It also explored associations between these changes and endorsement of suicide functions as an escape and/or as a solution, examined both as momentary thoughts and intractable beliefs about suicide. Thirty-nine community participants endorsing suicidal ideation were followed for two-weeks and completed multiple daily surveys related to suicidal thoughts, functions of suicide, and emotion intensity. Participants reported heightened emotion intensity immediately following a suicidal thought across six emotions, with delayed reductions in stress and anxiety following ideation onset. When assessed in the moment, suicide as a solution to a problem predicted increases in hopelessness, sadness, stress and general negative affect immediately following a thought, while suicide as an escape predicted increases in anger immediately after a thought. When measured as intractable beliefs, only stronger belief in suicide as a solution to a problem predicted delayed reductions in stress following ideation. Increased intensity of negative emotions immediately following suicidal ideation suggests a potential vicious cycle of heightened emotion intensity and suicidality.","[""Suicidality"", ""Experience sampling"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Real-time assessment"", ""Negative reinforcement""]",10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114027,
2,2,Across-subjects multiple baseline trial of exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for severe irritability: a study protocol,"Introduction Irritability is defined as a tendency towards anger in response to frustration. Clinically, impairing irritability is a significant public health problem. There is a need for mechanism-based psychotherapies targeting severe irritability as it manifests in the context of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). This study protocol describes a randomised multiple baseline design testing the preliminary efficacy of a new treatment, exposurebased cognitive-behavioral therapy for severe irritability in youth, which also integrates components of parent management training. We will investigate associations of this intervention with primary clinical measures, as well as ecological momentary assessment measures. Methods and analysis Forty youth will be enrolled. Participants, aged 8-17 years, must present at least one of two core symptoms of DMDD: abnormal mood or increased reactivity to negative emotional stimuli, with severe impairment in one domain (home, school, peers) and moderate in another, or moderate impairment in at least two domains. Each participant is randomised to a 2-week, 4-week or 6-week baseline observation period, followed by 12 active treatment sessions. Clinical ratings are conducted at baseline, biweekly (clinician), weekly (parent/child) throughout treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month and 6-month follow-up (clinician). Clinician ratings on the Affective Reactivity Index and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale for DMDD are our primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures include parent and child reports of irritability. Post hoc additional symptom measures include clinician, parent and self-ratings of depression, anxiety and overall functional impairment. Prospective, digitally based event sampling of symptoms is acquired for a week pretreatment, mid-treatment and post-treatment. Based on our pathophysiological model of irritability implicating frustrative non-reward, aberrant threat processing and instrumental learning, we probe these three brain-based targets using functional MRI paradigms to assess target engagement.

Clinically, impairing irritability is a significant public health problem,  and is among the most frequent presenting problems in youth psychiatric practice.  Longitudinally, irritability predicts depression, anxiety,  suicidality,  and is associated with functional impairment.  The need to diagnose address and treat youth with severe impairing irritability led to the inclusion of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th Strengths and limitations of this study ► This study protocol presents and tests a novel intervention to target core symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) symptoms (irritable mood, temper outbursts). ► This study protocol is employing parent management training (PMT) and principles of extinction derived from exposure therapy to target key mechanism of aberrant reward and threat processing, two core pathophysiologically informed dysfunctions posited in DMDD. ► The current protocol leverages state-of-the-art measures by collecting intensive, week-by-week clinical symptom data from patients, parents and trained clinicians, as well as behavioral and neural data from patients during the treatment. ► Despite the strengths and innovative aspects of the current study, the current multibaseline design is not a randomised controlled trial, therefore, it does not allow for strong causal inferences. ► The combination of both PMT and exposure techniques in the current treatment does not allow for separation of their effects. Open access edition (DSM-5). While this decision was somewhat controversial,  DMDD codifies clinically-significant temper outbursts and irritable mood. However, there is a need for additional evidence-based psychotherapies that specifically target the temper outbursts and irritable mood, the two core symptoms articulated in DMDD.  Coupled with this need, in recent years, there has been a movement towards treatment innovation based on engaging brain-behaviour targets that are hypothesised as translational mechanisms.  In this study, we test both clinical efficacy and target engagement of a cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) for severe irritability as it presents in DMDD. Only one prior treatment study targeting anger leverages pathophysiology to guide the treatment intervention.  Thus, additional mechanism-based, targeted interventions for DMDD are needed.  Biomarkers have transformed modern medicine but remain largely elusive in psychiatry. To date, treatments have either been serendipitous and/or developed primarily to address specific clinical symptoms. Augmenting this mechanism-driven approach, researchers    have suggested that experimental therapeutics should engage pathophysiological targets, while synergistically leveraging prior symptom-based theoretical approaches. Thus, here, we integrate and test mechanism-based approaches to target two core deficits in impairing irritability  : (1) aberrant reward processing and (2) aberrant threat processing. The inclusion of therapeutic techniques to target key mechanisms of irritability is intended to lead to more efficient, generalized and long-term outcomes.  Prior relevant treatments Some empirically supported interventions target irritability and disruptive behaviour as seen in disruptive behaviour disorders (DBD): attention-deficit\hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder. However, there are two opportunities to further build on this research. First, few existing interventions specifically target severe, impairing irritability and temper outbusts as present in the context of DMDD, which is a mood disorder as opposed to DBD.    Second, while there are a few categories of existing relevant empirically supported interventions: parent management training (PMT) and CBT for DBD, and dialectical behaviour therapy for preadolescent children (DBT-C) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) for DMDD, such treatments do not emphasise exposure techniques as a primary target. Meta-analytical evidence supports the efficacy of PMT in decreasing externalising behaviours, aggression, oppositionality and impulsivity characteristic of DBDs,  with a medium effect size for trials using blinded assessments.    For example, Parent-Child Interaction Therapy    is a manualized parent training intervention that has received substantial empirical support in the treatment of disruptive behaviour. Other interventions, such as the Incredible Years,  Stop now and Plan 36 and Kazdin's PMT,  are also evidence-based psychotherapies for externalising problems. However, most are targeted towards very young children  or target a broad spectrum of externalising problems.  Although some of these protocols include treating anger and aggressive outbursts  there is no protocol modified specifically to parents of youth with DMDD, potentially limiting the generalizability across symptom domains. Furthermore, studies of youth with ODD and ADHD have yet to systematically examine the effects of PMT on emotional symptoms, notably the irritable dimension.  PMT efficacy studies are needed to investigate the unique clinical and pathophysiological features of severe irritability in children and adolescents.  Early research suggests that youth with severe mood dysregulation show deficits during probabilistic response reversal and reversing previously rewarded associations.  It remains unknown whether PMT addresses such deficits in reward learning. CBT, which targets relationships among thoughts, behaviours and feelings,  has also shown efficacy in treating anger and disruptive behaviour.    Sukhodolsky et al  developed a CBT protocol for aggression using three modules: emotion regulation, social problemsolving and the social skills training aimed to prevent and resolve conflict situations. The first module starts with identifying anger triggers, developing prevention strategies and learning emotion regulation skills, such as cognitive reappraisal and relaxation training. The second module focuses on problem-solving skills, such as generating multiple solutions and considering different consequences and actions when dealing with conflicts. The final module focuses on developing skills for preventing or resolving potentially anger-provoking situations in different domains. In a meta-analysis of CBT for anger in youth, Sukhodolsky et al  reported a medium mean effect size across parent, teacher, observer and self-reports for physical aggression and/or delinquency in boys. Other meta-analyses and review papers examined the effect of evidence-based CBT/psychosocial treatments for disruptive behaviour or externalising disorders, showing mixed results for efficacy  ; however, the participants in those studies were not specifically referred for severe, impairing irritability. Although promising, such anger-based CBT protocols emphasise cognitive techniques (eg, generation of multiple solutions and the consideration of consequences for different courses of action in conflicts), rather than behavioral interventions. Several behavioral principles, such as exposure, might be explored in clinically irritable youth. Exposure techniques help patients to systematically approach aversive situations while resisting urges to avoid or escape. Such techniques teach patients to approach and tolerate triggering stimuli, despite their feared outcomes, using a graded hierarchy of exposure stimuli.    A recent promising clinical case report using the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children (UP-C)  demonstates a positive outcome in the treatment of a child with anger Open access and irritability.  UP-C, an emotion-focused transdiagnostic treatment for anger, consists of cognitive-behavioral techniques, encouraging patients to experience thoughts more mindfullly and neutrally. In a recent pilot study,  Hawks et al adapted the UP-C for the treatment of paediatric irritability in a sample of 19 children (ages  with primary presenting concerns of irritability and/or disruptive behaviours. Results supported the feasibility and acceptability of this treatment and provided preliminary evidence that such an approach may yield improved outcomes for symptoms of paediatric irritability and disruptive behaviours. Another recently published study by Evans et al  examined the effectiveness of a modular, transdiagnostic, behavioral/cognitive-behavioral intervention (MATCH), which is an existing flexible manual, for treating youth with severe irritability, compared with standard manualized treatments and usual care. Irritability was not specifically targeted in this larger study. MATCH showed the most consistent improvement in reducing irritability across multiple measurement schedules and informants. Taken together, the development and examination of expanded behavioral (eg, exposurebased) interventions targeting irritability requires further research, towards the goal of identifying active components effective in reducing irritability in youth with DMDD. In a complementary line of work, Perepletchikova et al  adapted DBT for preadolescent children (DBT-C), drawing from DBT  and its adolescent adaptation (DBT-A).  DBT-C provides youth and parents with skills training, coaching and therapy aimed to help families apply and generalize skills in mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, validation and behaviourism/reinforcement principles. An initial DBT-C randomised controlled trial (RCT) in a sample of youth with DMDD demonstrated efficacy.  At post-treatment assessment, following 32 weeks of DBT training, children reported a significant increase in adaptive coping skills and significant decreases in depressive symptoms and problematic internalising behaviours.  In additional work examining irritability in the context of mood disorders, a recent pilot RCT  assessed the feasibilty and preliminary efficacy of an adapted version of IPT for mood and behaviour dysregulation in youth with DMDD. Results indicated decreased outbursts and irritability and improved interpersonal interacting after treatment. In sum, paediatric adaptations of DBT and IPT show positive preliminary results in youth with DMDD. Collectively, accumulating evidence supports the efficacy of different treatment components of PMT, CBT, DBT and IPT in treating externalising behaviours, aggression, oppositionality, impulsivity and irritability across various diagnoses. This novel protocol intervention builds on prior treatments. First, the current protocol specifically targets youth's encoding of nonreward and threat stimuli in the context of frustration, and integrates approaches of CBT and PMT. Second, the current protocol emphasises in vivo behavioral exposure to anger-inducing stimuli, independent of skills training in the additional domains of distress tolerance, mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness and validation strategies. The current study The current protocol relies on a pathophysiological framework with the aim to implement CBT and PMT techniques to adress pathophysiological targets. Specifically, the intervention is capitalising on empirically supported and theory-driven interventions and posits two core mechanisms of impairing irritability: (1) exposure-based CBT to target exaggerated responses to frustrative nonreward and/or threatening stimuli and (2) PMT to target aberrant reward processing; with both mechanisms being mediated by abnormalities in frontoamygdalar circuitry. Some studies show that high irritability is associated with decreased activation in regulatory prefrontal regions during frustration,  and that these regions have a critical role in emotion processing by regulating activity of the amygdala.  Of note, regulation of amygdala activity by the prefrontal cortex seems to be one of the key mechanisms underlying exposure techniques.  Some evidence suggests that exposure might not be successful in treating proactive aggression  (representing predatory attacks motivated by external reward). However, irritability is characterised by reactive aggression,  meaning affectively driven aggressive responses to others' behaviour that is perceived as threatening or intentional. Here, we extend prior work by investigating CBT for chronic, severe and impairing irritability and temper outbursts. This CBT uses both in-session and betweensession in vivo exposures to anger-inducing stimuli as the primary behavioral technique. Previous evidence suggests that effective behavioral interventions targeting the threat system may also be applied to the treatment of anger-based disorders. Therefore, this protocol examines whether exposure to stimuli that evoke frustration and anger effectively reduces irritability. Similar to exposure therapy for anxiety and fear disorders, we conceptualise that exposure therapy will help severely irritable youth to increase their anger tolerance (without engaging in aggressive behaviours), decreasing manifestations of irritability, temper outburts and irritable mood. A novel aspect of the exposure work in the current study involves patient and therapist creating an anger hierarchy associated with different anger-inducing triggers for the patient. During therapy sessions, the therapist explicitly tries to evoke anger, before challenging the child to tolerate circumstances and demands, or to shape the environment to not acquiesce/reinforce. Our PMT intervention relies on the assumption that whether a child's difficulties in reward processing manifest through irritable behaviour is also dependent on the parental behaviours and parental contingency management. Hence, the current protocol consists of a modified PMT, including elements such as active ignoring and positive praise.  The incorporation of these PMT strategies aims to counteract deficits in frustrative non-reward Open access response and, in turn, improve the child's symptoms and distress.  An open pilot trial of exposure-based CBT procedures for DMDD demonstrated initial feasibility.  Preliminary results indicated a pre-treatment to post-treatment reduction in DMDD symptom severity, as measured by the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity and Improvement (CGI-S, CGI-I)  scale and the Clinician-Rated Affective Reactivity Index (CL-ARI).  This CL-ARI is a paediatric, semistructured interview assessing temper outbursts and irritable mood. In the open trial, independent raters were not blind to treatment status. The current protocol addresses this limitation, in which clinicians' expectations may bias results, by using a randomised, multiple baseline design that staggers treatment onset across individuals.  Multiple baseline study designs are commonly used in cases where the dependent variable is not expected to return to baseline after the treatment had been applied. This design has a few strengths including increased confidence that changes in outcomes are a result of the intervention, if those outcomes occur across cohorts. To this end, we designed a protocol focusing on 12 weeks of exposure-based CBT plus PMT. The first half of each session (30-45 min) involves the patient completing exposure exercises. Throughout the therapy, the work with the child focuses on exposure, generation of an anger hierarchy, and gradual in-session exposure, and includes motivational interviewing to address ambivalence regarding change. Sessions with parents (30-45 min) comprise psychoeducation on reward learning and parental contingency management; parents are coached to praise and acknowledge their child's adaptive behaviours, and to actively ignore maladaptive behaviours. Other PMT elements include giving commands, setting limits, increasing time spent on positive joint activities, and delivering intermittent rewards. In later sessions, the therapist works with the parents on how to tolerate their emotional distress in response to their child's irritability symptoms. In between sessions, child is practicing tolerating their own anger through exposure while the parents are asked to employ techniques and strategies they had learnt in sessions (See table 1A,B) and for more details). We expect, that over the course of the treatment, using exposure and PMT techniques, patients will have an increased ability to tolerate their own anger and frustration, and an increased ability to regulate their feelings and behaviours in the context of frustrative non-reward or threatening triggers manifested through a decrease in irritable mood and temper outbursts. Overall, we hypothesise that the treatment will lead to decreased irritability (decreased irritable mood and temper outbursts) in response to frustration and to an overall decrease in illness severity. Given the importance of examining target engagement in treatment studies,  we probe the hypothesised neural targets throughout the treatment based on our pathophysiological model of irritability.  Specifically, participants complete resting state and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging Open access (fMRI) scans at different time points. Three fMRI paradigms assessing frustration, attention to threat and reward learning, separately, are included.  These paradigms test two hypotheses. First, we hypothesise that pre-treatment patterns of neural task activation will differentiate responders and non-responders (i.e., predictors or moderators). In an exploratory manner, we examine if activation and behavioral dysfunction across tasks can be used to determine who is most likely to benefit from treatment. Second, we predict that clinical improvement from pre-treatment to post-treatment will be mediated by prefrontal, striatal and amygdala circuit changes (i.e., mediation).   METHODS AND ANALYSIS The current study investigates exposure-based CBT and PMT for chronic, severe irritability and temper outbursts as they present in DMDD. Procedures Informed consent and assent are obtained from parents and youth, respectively, after complete description of study procedures and prior to study procedures. All participants are advised that research is voluntary and that they may withdraw participation at any time. Participants and parents complete a pre-treatment clinical evaluation onsite before being enrolled in the protocol. A trained and licensed masters-level or doctoral-level clinician conducts interviews with the participants and parents. We screen participants and follow them for several months prior to randomisation; any medication changes must be made prior to randomisation. We communicate to the family and the community treatment provider that once the child is randomised, the regimen cannot be changed unless there is an acute clinical need. Once patient is enrolled in the study, the child's prescriptions are written by a National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) psychiatrist who is working with the study team.   with the additional DMDD supplement.  Additionally, based on record review and  Recruitment Table 1A Continued Open access interviews with the child and parent, the clinical research team must agree that if the child is in active treatment, the child's response to their current treatment is no more than minimal determined by a score of 3 or more on the CGI-S. Unless there is an acute clinical need, participants must have no planned changes in outpatient psychiatric treatment regimen, which can include any psychotropic medications and/or psychotherapeutic interventions, 2 weeks prior to enrollment and throughout the weeks of treatment and post-treatment assessment. Participants are excluded if the irritability symptoms are due to the direct physiological effects of a drug, or to a general medical or neurological condition. Additionally, participants who meet DSM-5 criteria, as assessed by the K-SADS-PL,  for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective illness, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), major depressive episode, or post-traumatic stress disorder, are also excluded. ASD exclusion is operationalized using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA),  the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS),  the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ)  and the Children's Communication Checklist-Second Edition (CCC-2)  Specifically, we use cut-off scores of >75 on SRS, >15 on SCQ and <-15 on CCC. When one of these scores is above cut-off, with a combination of a DAWBA score, that is, ≥4, the participant is excluded. Participants are not eligible if they exhibit active suicidality or any cardinal bipolar symptoms, such as elevated or expansive mood, grandiosity or inflated self-esteem, and\or decreased need for sleep. Participants with other comorbid psychiatric problems (e.g., ADHD, anxiety disorders, past major depressive disorder; MDD) are not excluded from participation in this study. Study design Forty youth meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. Table  provides a detailed schedule of enrollment and intervention as well as a list of each of the measures being collected at each time point in the trial timeline. Each participant undergoes a randomised baseline observation period of 2, 4 or 6 weeks, followed by active treatment, and finally, post-treatment and follow-up observation periods (at 3 months and at 6 months following treatment termination). The multiple baseline design of the study controls for overall effects of time and regression towards the mean.  Rating clinicians (table ) are blinded to randomisation status of the participant and the timepoint the participant is in the trial at the time of the rating to control for clinician expectations. Randomisation to the different baseline points is independent to whether or not participants completed IBT study prior to starting the current protocol. Follow-up clinician-reported, child-reported and parent-reported primary and secondary outcomes are obtained at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. All visits are at the NIMH. All participants receive the active treatment.  Twelve weekly sessions last 60-90 min in an NIMH outpatient clinic, with both individual and joint child and parent meetings. There is one primary clinician treating the youth. Therapeutic procedures engaged in sessions are outlined in table 1A,B).  available upon request The manual involves a variety of exposure-based CBT procedures, such as creating hierarchies of irritabilityinducing events, exposure exercises (e.g., role-play, in vivo and imaginal), and PMT techniques (e.g., praise/ acknowledgement, pleasant interactions and unexpected rewards).    The exposures and the modules in the PMT are designed to be flexibly delivered and tailored for the specific issues and anger-inducing triggers identified by the individual child and their parents; therefore, the PMT modules will be adapted to account for age differences and will address the most salient problem areas identified using parent feedback. The main clinical outcomes we plan to assess are changes in irritability and overall illness severity and improvement. Changes in irritability will be assessed biweekly by clinician raters. Illness severity will be assessed biweekly and improvement will be assessed at mid-treatment and posttreatment. Illness severity at the end of the treatment will be compared with pre-treatment severity to determine the treatment's impact on the patient's overall severity of illness and to ascertain a frequently used global designation of 'responder' status.  The secondary clinical outcomes that will be assessed are child-reported and parent-reported irritability assessed weekly, and in vivo ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measures of mood and impairment, assessed pre-treatment, mid-treatment and post-treatment. Post hoc additional symptom measures include clinician-rated depressive and anxiety symptoms and functional impairment assessed biweekly. Additional secondary child-rated and parent-rated clinical outcomes include depressive and anxiety symptoms and aggression reported at pretreatment and post-treatment. Modifications made due to COVID-19 Due to the circumstances of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, recruitment was paused for about 5 months (Mid-March to mid-August 2020). To accommodate the protocol, we are continuing to adhere to the manual and provide treatment remotely. For patients going through the trial when the stay-at-home orders started, we shifted to telehealth. Exposures continue to be conducted and, in some ways, have benefited from being able to use the home as context in the exposures and parents being more at home to use in the exposures. Scans had stopped since mid-March. Procedures for administration of clinical, child and parent report measures, as well as EMA, stayed similar as to the rest of the trial, with the exception of the presession ARI allowed to be collected up to 2 days before the session for the pre-session, and postsession alliance measures allowed to be collected almost a week after the session. Self-report and parent report measures require more effort to assure compliance as these are collected remotely and via technology as opposed to on site as  Open access Continued Open access before. For the clinician ARI, clinicians consider the new circumstances of virtual schooling and being more at home, when evaluating impairment at school, at home and with peers. To protect privacy and due to lack of feasibility, sessions are no longer being recorded. While attempting to both, address some of the mental health burdens brought on by the pandemic and being compliant with protocol modules, it is challenging to address all the additional pandemic-related mental health difficulties such as kids' outbursts being more severe or parents changing their parenting style due to elevated stress. The potential effect of the pandemic on the results will be tested during data analysis, comparing and/or controlling the two groups of kids recruited before and after the pandemic outbreak. Discontinuation/modification criteria The criteria for discontinuing the trial include the patients' request to discontinue or if the participant's condition worsens. All participants are informed that they may discontinue participation at their request at any time and for any reason and that they will not lose any benefits to which they are otherwise entitled. Also, if a participant's condition worsens to where it would be deemed unsafe or clinically inappropriate for participation to continue as determined by the clinical team, then participant will be withdrawn from the trial. The patient's own care providers in the community would be contacted to discuss immediate care. Patient and public involvement For 2 years prior to the development of the treatment, informal focus groups were conducted with children with severe irritability to assess the priorities, potential experience and preferences of the children and family for whom the treatment was being developed. Questions during these informal meetings centred around preferred goals of the treatment, what parents and children were willing to do (questions on burden to participant and motivation), and identification of appropriate language for communications with the public to increase recruitment and interest. The research team also engaged in discussions with community providers during local and national presentations. The feedback from families and clinical professionals were geared towards making the treatment more generalizable, acceptable, feasible and equitable for the patient population under study. Measures Table  provides a clinical assessment timeline. In addition, treatment constructs are summarised in table . Primary outcome measures include the CL-ARI  to measure changes in irritability and CGI-Severity (CGI-S)    and CGI-Improvement (CGI-I)  scales to measure overall illness severity and improvement, respectively. The CL-ARI is a 12 items semistructured interview for DMDD designed to be administered by a trained clinician (master's level or above) to parents and children. The CL-ARI total score is the weighted sum of three subscale scores: temper outbursts (range of 0-27), irritable mood between outbursts (range of 0-8) and impairment (range of 0-15). Items are scored on Likert scales. Temper outburst frequency is scored on a 5-point scale, separately for mild, moderate and severe outbursts (0=none, 4=more than one outburst every day). Temper outburst duration is scored on a 6-point scale (0=none, 5=60 min). The irritable mood frequency item has a  Open access 4-point scale (0=none, 3=four or more days). The irritable mood duration item queries whether irritable mood was present for most of the day (i.e., at least half the day with a yes/no response option), and is only completed if the irritable mood frequency rating is scored at the maximum score (3=four or more days). The irritable mood severity item has a 6-point scale (0=not present, 5=severe). Last, impairment is rated separately in three different settings (family, school, peers) on 6-point scales (0=none, 5=severe). CL-ARI had a good reliabilty (Cronbach'sα=0.89) and validity scores.  CGI-S is is a single-item, 7-point measure of overall DMDD severity (1=normal, 7=most extreme) over the past month. The CGI scales are commonly used in psychiatric clinical trials, for which they have established utility and reliability.  Secondary outcome measures include parent and child report of irritability (child-rated and parent-rated ARI).  Additionally, we probe other co-occurring phenotypes in study, using clinician ratings of depressive symptoms (Children's Depression Rating Scale),  anxiety symptoms (Paediatric Anxiety Rating Scale)  and functional impairment (Children's Global Assessment Scale).  Children and parents provide reports on the child's symptoms of anxiety (Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders-child, SCARED  ; and SCAREDparent,  , respectively), aggression (Modified Overt Aggression Scale),  and depression (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, MFQ).  All of these measures demonstrated good internal consistency and discriminant validity in previous studies. Finally, EMA measures, a form of real-time digitally based event sampling are obtained to augment clinical phenotyping procedures, in addition to traditional clinical rating data.  Parents and children are prompted by smartphones for 7 days, three times per day, to answer questions about child symptoms and outbursts (occurring both, 'at the time of the beep' and 'since the last beep'), and functional impairment, and corresponded parental responses. The effect of the treatment on EMA measures will be assessed. Data quality of all measures in this study is continually monitored and checked postcollection. Treatment process measures Adherence measures were developed for this study to assess therapist fidelity and competence. With informed consent and assent, all treatment sessions are video recorded or audio recorded. Following each session, therapists rate themselves on adherence measures, and external raters blind to clinical outcome complete additional, observer ratings based on the recordings. Therapists, patients, parents and independent raters also assess the therapeutic alliance following every session.    To improve adherence and minimise drift, group supervision facilitated by the developer of the treatment where the manual is reviewed is conducted weekly throughout the trial. Study therapists review each other's session recordings to provide feedback during supervision. Neuroimaging measures At pre-treatment, mid-treatment and post-treatment, participants complete resting state,  as well as a frustration fMRI task (Affective Posner (AP3)).  At pretreatment and post-treatment, participants complete a threat attention orienting task (Dot-Probe)    and an instrumental reward learning task (Carnival) that also includes a frustration induction. Finally, diffusion tensor imaging,  a structural neuroimaging measure of neural circuitry, is also collected pre-treatment to estimate the location, orientation and anisotropy of the brain's white matter tracts. Scans are completed within 3 weeks of pre-treatment (session 1) and post-treatment (session 12). To ensure that all participants have the same exposure to stimuli, participants who are unable or unwilling to scan (e.g., braces) complete these tasks behaviorally outside of the scanner. fMRI tasks AP3 Task This task models frustrative non-reward by inducing, and then violating, the expectation of reward during an attention orienting task (see figure  for task overview). The task is organised into three blocks consisting of a series of timed-response trials in which participants identify a target following a cue (i.e., Posner task).  At the end of each trial, children receive accuracy feedback, and, after the first block, win or lose money on each trial. On all trials, a black screen is presented between the target/ response and the feedback slide. During the first block, participants are told to respond as quickly as possible to the stimuli and that there is no reward or punishment, but they receive feedback on their accuracy. This block consists two non-frustration runs outside the scanner that set up the expectation for reward. During the second block, inside the scanner, participants are introduced to the monetary contingency and win or lose US$0.50 when they make a correct or incorrect response, respectively. The third block, inside the scanner, is the frustration condition, during which feedback is rigged such that 60% of correct trials are followed by negative feedback and a loss of US$0.50, and 40% of correct responses are followed by positive feedback and a gain of US$0.50. Trials in which participants make incorrect responses are followed by accurate feedback. Finally, fixation trials, during which participants focus on a fixation mark in the centre of the screen, are included to facilitate comparisons between brain activity during task trials following wining/losing. At the end of each block, participants are asked to report the valence of their emotional response and their level of frustration. The AP3 task  is a wellestablished task used in multiple studies, including in the context of DMDD,  to investigate the circuitry mediating frustration. Previous studies demonstrate that in response to negative feedback received in the context of frustration, children with severe, chronic irritability are showing abnormal activations in regions implicated in emotion, attention, and reward processing. Open access Dot-Probe Task This task measures threat-related attention orientation. There is an expanding literature using this task showing threat-related  attention bias in samples with high levels of anxiety and irritability. To date, fMRI research using the dot-probe task yields generally consistent findings of individual differences in anxiety related to perturbed function in brain regions supporting emotional processing (e.g., amygdala) and attentional control (e.g., ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, vlPFC; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dlPFC).  In the current study, participants complete a faces-based variant of the dot-probe task,  (following the TAU-NIMH ABMT Initiative protocol (http:// people. socsci. tau. ac. il/ mu/ anxietytrauma/ research/). The task includes 120 trials: 80 threat-neutral and 40 neutralneutral (see figure  for task trial (see figure  for task overview). In each trial, a pair of faces appears following a fixation cross. Following the face display, a probe appears on the screen (i.e., '<' or '>') in the location of a previously viewed either neutral (i.e., incongruent trials) or threatening face (i.e., congruent trials). Participants are instructed to indicate the orientation of the probe by clicking the left or right button of a button box. The probe remains on screen until a response is registered, and then the next trial begins. Attention bias to threat scores are calculated from reaction times (RTs) on the threat-neutral face display trials by subtracting congruent trial RTs from incongruent trial RTs.  Positive attention bias to threat scores reflect a bias towards threat; negative scores reflect a bias away from threat. The Dot-Probe task starts with a resting state phase measuring pre-task brain activity at rest.   Carnival task This task is designed to examine reward vs loss learning in relation to irritability, both at baseline and following an acute frustration induction, and to investigate neural substrates involved in these processes. There are no previous studies examining reward learning per se in the context of DMDD. Related studies showed striatal dysfunction in the context of reward learning as compared with healthy youth.  Youth with conduct problems, showed   et al (2009) that is available to the public. We followed the terms and conditions listed for using the set and agreed to use the images for research purposes only. The manuscript includes models that are listed as ones which are permitted to be published in scientific journals (see this link for more details: https://www. macbrain.org/resources.htm). Open access atypical modulation of striatal activity based on stimulus expected value.  The task simulates a set of Carnival games and has three phases (see figure  for task overview). In the first and last phases, participants view pairs of objects on the left and right sides of the computer screen, respectively. The paired stimuli are in different colours, and switch their location on the screen randomly. Participants hold a grip force response device (dynamometer) in each hand, and grip one of the devices while the stimuli are on the screen in order to select that stimulus in an attempt to obtain a monetary reward (US$0.50). After participants respond, the screen acknowledges their selection by showing an image of a mallet overlaid on the selected stimulus. Next, a feedback screen appears indicating whether the selected stimulus is rewarded: 'Win 50¢!' or 'No Win.' During this phase, participants learn over the course of three different sets of paired stimuli to select the stimulus that is followed more frequently by reward. In the second or middle phase, participants view images on the screen that simulate a whack-a-mole game. For 40% of participants' correct responses, the selection is followed by a reward ('Win 50¢!'). For the other 60% of correct responses, feedback is rigged, or followed by no reward ('No Win'). Incorrect responses are always followed by no reward. All images are original to the task. At the end of each phase, participants rate their levels of frustration, excitement and unhappiness.  Baseline assignment Baseline assignment sequence is created via a computerbased random number generator. Randomisation is performed in blocks of 10 participants with a 1:1 ratio within blocks. Rating clinicians are blind as to the current trial phase at time of ratings, as well as the baseline condition assignment. The blind is not broken for the entire cohort until completion of the trial. Sample size and power analysis The sample size of this study is expected to include N=40 completers. To account for dropout, we have determined the total sample size of enrolment to be N=60. Medium to large effects (d=0.6-1.2) were detected in the pilot treatment conducted in our group using the current manual.  There is no standard power analysis for multiple baseline designs. However, prior studies using this design with similar effect sizes generally have enrolled 6-18 participants.  Various meta-analyses estimate the effect size of the psychological treatment/psychological placebo difference to be 0.40-0.60.  A sensitivity-power analyses using G*Power v3.1 showed that with 40 participants, an error rate of 0.05 and a power of 0.95, a large effect size of d=0.81 is required, using within-subjects analyses, while accounting multiple comparisons corrections.  Since in the current study all participants receive an active treatment, we expect the effect size to be above and beyond placebo effect reported in the literature, and to be large in magnitude. We will use intention-to-treat analyses for noncompliance and missing outcomes, using last observation carried forward approach.   Data analysis We will test the null hypothesis of no difference in DMDD symptoms improvement between time points across the randomised baseline schedules. Both visual inspection Open access of the data and multilevel modelling in which repeated trials are nested within each subject will be used.  Mixed models will be performed to examine symptom change over time for each of the ARI measures (clinician, child and parent rated) and the clinician-rated anxiety and depressive symptom measures. The slopes of the baseline phase will be modelled and compared with the slopes of the treatment phase to identify differential slopes between phases. Effect sizes will be calculated to assess if the treatment is associated with symptom improvement in clinician-rated severity of illness and functioning, and parent and child rated anxiety, depression and aggression. In addition to calculating statistical significance for all inferential tests, we will calculate clinically significant change for ARI measures and secondary outcome measures, using the method recommended by Jacobson and Truax.  CGI-I, a measure of improvement, will also be used to determine clinical change. For EMA ratings, we will use multilevel modelling to evaluate a pre-to-post-treatment increase in parental rewards for adaptive child behaviour, and decrease in rewards for irritable behaviour. Although the current design does not allow us to measure adjunctive versus separate effects of PMT vs exposure, based on sessions recording, we will calculate the dosage of each intervention at the individual level, and measure associations between intervention type proportion and treatment efficacy/clinical change. fMRI analyses will test for pre-treatment vs post-treatment differences in frontostriatal engagement after frustrative nonreward (AP3 and Carnival) and in frontostriatal-amygdala engagement during threat processing (Dot-probe). For each task, fMRI analysis will also compare pre-treatment and post-treatment resting state connectivity. For the AP3 task, we will compare activation on the N+1 trial after rigged versus positive feedback. The AP3 task will also be used to examine whether neural changes at mid-treatment predate or mediate clinical symptom change at post-treatment. Resting state data will explore changes in default mode, attentional and salience networks over the course of treatment. For each task, we will calculate separateanalyses of variance for CGI-I and CL-ARI to test post-treatment ratings × task condition × time (scan 1, 2) interactions. The model for CL-ARI will covary pre-treatment ratings. ETHICS To participate, parents must give written informed consent and the children must provide written assent. The research project and all related materials were submitted and approved by the appropriate IRB of the NIMH, which deemed the study to involve minimal risks. Adverse experiences include mild psychological distress and discomfort when responding to interview questions or questionnaires, engaging in the exposure-based treatment, or boredom during scanning or tasking. The principal and associate investigators monitor patients closely (e.g., at least weekly) throughout their participation in the study. Data management and monitoring Questionnaires and clinical ratings' data are managed through an IRB-approved password-protected institutional secure database, NIH Clinical Trials Database.

3,3,An Ecological Momentary Assessment of College Women's Decisions to Use Protective Behavioral Strategies,"Protective behavioral strategies (PBS) have been associated with reduced risk for sexual assault victimization in college women. Sexual assault risk reduction programs have had limited success increasing PBS use, particularly among heavy drinkers, suggesting a need for additional research on the malleable predictors of PBS use. Whereas longitudinal studies show women's decisions to use PBS can be both planned and reactive, little is known about the decision-making processes that affect PBS use on drinking days, when sexual assault risk may be elevated. The current study used ecological momentary assessment to examine variability in the associations between decision-making and PBS use within and across drinking days in first-semester college women. Participants (56 female drinkers) completed a 14-day protocol with three daily measures of intentions and willingness to use PBS, and once-daily diaries of PBS use. Multilevel models examined between-day and within-day effects of intentions and willingness to use PBS with regards to sexual assault PBS (e.g., communicating sexual boundaries) and drinking PBS (e.g., limiting alcohol consumption), respectively. On days when sexual assault PBS willingness increased throughout the day, women tended  to  use  more  sexual  assault  PBS.  This  association  was  strongest  among  women  who  were  typically  less  willing  to  use  these  PBS.  Among  women who were the least willing to use drinking PBS, their drinking PBS use decreased  on  days  when  they  reported  increased  willingness  to  use  them.  Decisions  to  use  sexual  assault  and  drinking  PBS  on  drinking  days  were qualified by women¡¯s typical levels of willingness to use the different PBS.  This  suggests  the  need  for  a  multi-faceted  intervention  strategy  that  targets both typical and event-level risk. Individual-level alcohol and sexual assault risk reduction approaches could be enhanced with event-level PBS messaging and evaluation","[""ecological  momentary  assessment"",  ""protective  behavioral  strategies"",  ""sexual  assault risk"", ""alcohol consumption"", ""college women""]",10.1177/08862605211005143,"Nearly one quarter of college women experience sexual assault in the United States . Risk for victimization is particularly high among younger students (i.e., those under the age of 21) who engage in heavy episodic drinking (HED; i.e., consuming four or more drinks on a single occasion; . Even women who typically consume less are at increased risk on days when they consume more than their typical amounts . The underlying mechanisms that explain the association between alcohol and sexual assault risk are well-established and multifaceted (see . Studies show that men perceive intoxicated women to be more sexually available or interested ; women who are drinking heavily also have a delayed recognition of and response to sexual assault risk. As such, perpetrators may be more inclined to prey on women who are drinking. Although sexual assault risk only exists in the presence of a perpetrator, alcohol is involved in over 50% of sexual assaults that occur on college campuses , warranting prevention strategies that address alcohol-related risk . Sexual assault risk reduction programs are an integral component of comprehensive prevention efforts and address multiple risk and protective factors . Risk reduction programs assert sexual assault is always the perpetrator's fault and also empower women to minimize the likelihood they will be targeted as a potential victim . A core mechanism of this prevention approach has been to increase use of sexual assault protective behavioral strategies (PBS; . Sexual assault PBS include strategies for setting and communicating personal boundaries (e.g., determining in advance what one is willing to do in a sexual situation) and deterring harm in situations where sexual assault risk may be present (e.g., walking home with trusted friends, being prepared to use forceful verbal or physical resistance strategies if necessary; . Several attempts have been made to tailor this risk reduction approach for heavy drinking women . These programs have typically expanded the discussion of PBS to include drinking PBS, which aim to limit alcohol consumption (e.g., consuming no more than one drink per hour; planning not to exceed three drinks in a night) or modify the manner of drinking (e.g., alternating alcohol and non-alcoholic beverages; avoiding shots) to minimize the potential negative effects of intoxication . Whereas sexual assault PBS have been directly associated with decreased sexual assault victimization in college women , drinking PBS have been indirectly associated with fewer incidents of forced and unwanted sex by first reducing alcohol consumption . Several rigorous evaluation studies of risk reduction programs have reported significant effects on sexual assault victimization (e.g.,  and alcohol-involved sexual assault, specifically . Program impacts on PBS use have been less consistent, especially in samples of heavy drinkers . This gap could be a function of measurement specificity. Prospective evaluation studies measure typical PBS use averaged over several months . This level of measurement does not account for whether or how women tailor their PBS use in response to interpersonal or contextual risk on a given day. Existing programs may also be insufficiently addressing the upstream factors that motivate an individual to use PBS . Relatively little is known about the processes that inform women's decisions to use PBS, and no studies have examined these processes on days when women drink and may be at increased risk for victimization. A better understanding of the malleable constructs that inform PBS use on drinking days is needed to enhance prevention efforts. Decisions to Use PBS Research shows women's decisions to use PBS can be complex, operating through core processes that are both planned (i.e., intentional) and emotionally reactive (i.e., one's willingness to use PBS based on the social situation; . Studies reveal that intentions and willingness tend to be positively associated, but when examined simultaneously, they each account for significant unique variance in predicting behavioral outcomes (e.g., .  observed women's intentions and willingness were positively correlated with each other (r = .78), but each accounted for unique and significant proportions of variance in predicting future sexual assault PBS use. The role of intentions in PBS use is consistent with prior literature that has shown positive health behaviors (e.g., healthy eating) tend to be more intentional or planned compared to health risk behaviors (e.g., substance use), which tend to be more reactive . Studies such as these tend to examine associations between intentions/willingness assessed at one time and behavioral outcomes assessed a month to several months later. The limitation of this approach is that it does not account for situational changes in decision making or PBS use. The current study attempted to fill this gap by examining event-level intentions and willingness to use PBS and behavioral outcomes on days when women might be at increased risk for victimization. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is an event-level methodology that allows for repeated measurement of events, experiences, or behaviors as they occur in real time and in participants' natural environments . The EMA approach provides a method to examine the answers to more nuanced process-based questions, such as: (a) Does the influence of decision-theoretical constructs (intentions and willingness) on PBS use vary from day to day? (b) Does the influence vary within a day leading up to a drinking event? (c) Is the influence of within-or between-day variability affected by individuals' typical decision-making patterns? Answers to these questions could provide insight into factors that decrease risk on a given day and inform the optimal timing and theoretical targets for interventions. For example, observed variability in the influence of intentions on PBS use from one day to the next might suggest existing risk reduction programs could be enhanced by encouraging women to consistently plan for what PBS they might use when they go out. Alternatively, observing variability within a day (e.g., if PBS use becomes more likely as intentions increase throughout the day) might suggest the need for supplemental event-specific interventions that make PBS use seem appealing right before or throughout a night out. Understanding these processes can help inform the nature of prevention efforts to increase overall PBS use, empower women to think about which PBS may be most beneficial in different situations, and subsequently reduce harm. The Current Study The current study used a 14-day EMA design to examine decision-making constructs associated with sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS. To understand the decision-making processes women use on days when they could be at increased risk for victimization, the current study examined PBS used only on drinking days. Further, drinking days are plausible and easily identifiable targets for intervention, both globally and at the event-level. Research suggests that, on average, women use more sexual assault PBS when they have greater intentions and willingness to do so . The current study aimed to explore these associations at the event level for both sexual assault and drinking PBS by answering the following research questions (RQ): (a) Do women use more sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so are higher than normal (e.g., withinperson/between-day effects)? (b) Do women use more sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so increase throughout the day, relative to when they decrease or stay the same (e.g., within-day effects)? (c) Do event-level associations between PBS use and decision-theoretical constructs vary based on one's average overall levels of intentions and willingness (e.g., between-person by within-person interaction effects)? These hypothesized associations were tested separately for sexual assault and drinking PBS because they may require unique intervention approaches for increased use. The effects of intentions and willingness were examined simultaneously (e.g., the effect of willingness controlling for one's average level of intentions) because previous research has identified both as being integral and complementary in the behavioral decision-making process . Answers to these questions will provide critical insight into how typical risk reduction approaches might be enhanced to address HED and event-level risk. Method Recruitment A random sample of 750 women was selected from the university registrar's database of incoming students at a large, public northeastern university. Students received personalized introductory letters and email invitations describing the study and containing a URL and PIN for accessing a consent form and brief web-based screening survey. Non-respondents received up to seven personalized email reminders. Approximately, 58% (n = 436) enrolled and completed the screening, resulting in a response rate comparable to other studies using similar web-based recruitment methods with new students transitioning into the university (e.g., . Over half of enrolled students met eligibility criteria (54%; n = 235), which included (a) having a 4G network smartphone and (b) reporting at least one heavy drinking episode in the past month (i.e., consuming four or more drinks on a single occasion; . Ineligible students were paid $5 and removed from the participant list. Eligible students were directed to the baseline assessment and paid $15 for their time. Students also earned a $5 rapid completion bonus if they completed the survey within 3 days of the initial invitation. EMA Study Procedures Following baseline assessment, two-thirds of participants (n = 156) were randomly selected for the EMA study; the remaining third was assigned to a reactivity control group. Students assigned to the current study were directed to a scheduling tool and invited to continue in the study by signing up for a required training on Snap Mobile, a mobile phone application used for daily data collection. Research staff made up to two phone calls and sent three additional emails to follow up with eligible students who did not schedule electronically or to reschedule participants who missed their scheduled session; participants also received text message reminders the night before their selected training session. Approximately, 54% (n = 84) of those invited, or 19% of all screened participants, attended training and enrolled in the EMA study. There were no significant differences between students who enrolled and students who did not enroll on age, race/ethnicity, baseline drinking, or PBS use (all ps > .05). The current study employed a 14-day event-and signal-contingent EMA protocol. Upon waking each morning, participants logged into their Snap Mobile app to complete a short survey of the previous day's drinking and PBS use. At the end of this morning survey, participants also completed their first prospective momentary assessments of intentions and willingness to use PBS on that day. Two additional momentary assessments of intentions and willingness occurred randomly between 2:00 pm and 6:00 pm and between 7:00 pm and 11:00 pm each day. Text message reminders were sent at 9:00 am on weekdays/10:00 am on weekends, and again at 12:30 pm for daily diaries (the survey closed at 1:00 pm daily); reminders for the afternoon and evening momentary assessments were sent 30 minutes before each survey period closed. Participants received $30 for participation, with a $20 bonus if they achieved at least 90% compliance on the daily morning assessments. To further encourage compliance, participants were entered into a lottery for each survey they completed; five lottery winners were randomly selected at the end of the study, with prizes ranging from $50 to $250. All study procedures were reviewed and approved by the university's Institutional Review Board. Participants Only the days on which participants reported drinking were included in analyses, as the current study aimed to understand PBS use on drinking days. The final sample included 56 participants who reported at least 1 drinking event during the 14-day assessment period with corresponding momentary data from the prior day. The mean age of the sample was 18.05 years (SD = 0.23). Most participants identified as Caucasian (82.1%), although other racial/ethnic backgrounds were represented (10.7% African American, 5.4% multiracial, 5.5% Hispanic). All participants lived on campus, and many intended to join intramural/club sports (55.4%) or sororities (42.9%) in their first semester. At baseline, participants reported consuming an average of 8.71 (SD = 6.06) drinks per week. Measures PBS If participants reported drinking the day/night before, within their daily waking recall assessments, they were asked to indicate which, if any, PBS they used (1 = Yes; 0 = No). For both types of PBS, briefer versions of established scales were used to keep daily assessments short and minimize response burden . The sexual assault PBS measure included six items from the Dating Self-Protection Against Rape Scale . Items were selected based on preliminary work identifying the types of behaviors women tend to use most frequently . Sample items included, ""Letting a friend or family member know where you are,"" and ""Walking home with a trusted friend."" A summed score was created to indicate the number of sexual assault PBS used on each drinking occasion. The drinking PBS measure included six items from the Protective Behavioral Strategies Scale . Items with factor loadings of at least 0.65  were selected from each subscale, including Stopping/Limiting Drinking (e.g., determined in advance not to exceed a set number of drinks), Manner of Drinking (e.g., avoided trying to keep up with or out drink others), and Serious Harm Reduction (e.g., tried to know where my drink was at all times). A summed score was created to indicate the number of drinking PBS used on each drinking occasion. Behavior-specific Intentions Each of the three daily momentary assessments asked participants about the activities they intended to engage in later that day. They were asked, ""Do you 'intend' to engage in any social activities today/tonight?"" (1 = Yes; 0 = No) and ""Do you 'intend' to drink?"" (1 = Yes; 0 = No). If drinking intentions were affirmed, participants also indicated which, if any, PBS from the lists above they intended to use (1 = Yes; 0 = No). Summed scores were created to indicate the number of sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS participants intended to use within each drinking occasion. Behavior-specific Willingness Similar to intentions, participants were presented with willingness questions specific to each behavior. They were asked, ""Are you 'willing' to engage in social activities tonight, should the opportunity arise?"" (1 = Yes; 0 = No) and ""Are you 'willing' to drink?"" (1 = Yes; 0 = No). If affirmed, participants indicated which sexual assault and drinking PBS they were willing to use (1 = Yes; 0 = No). Summed scores indicated the number of sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS participants were willing to use on each occasion. Analytic Strategy A series of four multilevel regression models were estimated in SAS (v. 9.4) to examine within-person/between-day effects (RQ1), within-day effects (RQ2), and cross-level interaction effects (RQ3; between-person X withinperson/day) of decision-theoretic constructs (intentions and willingness) on daily PBS use. Prior to analysis, waking recall assessments of the prior day's PBS use were lagged by one day and merged to match with the previous day's momentary assessments of intentions and willingness. Because predictor variables were assessed at a lower level (within day) than the outcome variables (between day), the lower level data (three momentary assessments of intentions and willingness within a day) were aggregated . Within-day aggregation was conducted in two ways to answer unique research questions. First, all three momentary assessments were averaged to create a day-level mean for intentions and willingness to use sexual assault and drinking PBS, respectively (RQ1). The second aggregation method created behavior-specific change scores ) by subtracting intention and willingness values reported at the first assessment within each day from the value reported at the third assessment within each day (RQ2). Positive values indicated an increase in intentions or willingness throughout the day, whereas negative values indicated a decrease. Missing data within the final analytic sample were handled using Full Information Maximum Likelihood , and outcome-specific unconditional means models confirmed the utility of the intended multilevel approach. The first set of models examined whether daily intentions and willingness to use PBS predicted actual PBS use on a given drinking day. Each behavioral outcome (sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS) was regressed onto behavior-specific day-level means of intentions and willingness. For example, sexual assault PBS use was regressed onto day-level means of intentions and willingness to use sexual assault PBS. To separate within-and betweenperson effects, predictors were group-mean centered at Level 1 (i.e., centered around the individual's mean) and grand-mean centered at Level 2 (i.e., centered around the sample mean). A second set of models examined whether within-day changes in intentions and willingness to use PBS predicted PBS use on a given drinking day. Again, using separate models for sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS, each behavioral outcome was regressed onto behavior-specific within-day changes in intentions and willingness to use PBS at Level 1 and grand-mean centered intentions and willingness to use PBS at Level 2. Within each model, we estimated both main effects (RQ1 & RQ2) and within-domain cross-level interactions (e.g., Level 1 intentions × Level 2 intentions; Level 1 willingness × Level 2 willingness; RQ3). Results Participants provided 368 total assessments (M = 6.57/person). Intraclass correlation coefficients from the unconditional means models indicated .85 of the variability in sexual assault PBS and .78 of the variability in drinking PBS occurred between-persons, leaving 15% and 22% of the variability, respectively, to be accounted for at the event-level. Results from the multilevel models predicting both sexual assault and drinking PBS are included in Table . For each outcome, results of RQ1 (between-day effects of intentions and willingness) are presented in the top panel and results of RQ2 (withinday changes in intentions and willingness) are presented in the bottom panel. The cross-level interaction terms within each panel (Rows 6, 7, 12, and 13) represent results for RQ3. Each will be discussed in turn. On any given drinking day, assuming average levels of PBS intentions and willingness, women used 2.76 (SE = 0.12) sexual assault PBS and 2.90 (SE = 0.17) drinking PBS (Table , Row 1). The main effects of daily intentions and willingness to use PBS on PBS use were not significant for either outcome (Rows 4 and 5). Thus, there was no evidence to suggest women used more sexual assault PBS or drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so were higher than normal. RQ2: Do Women Use More PBS on Days When Their Intentions and Willingness to Do So Increase Throughout the Day? Consistent with the first set of models, on any given drinking day, and assuming average intentions and willingness, women used 2.76 (SE = 0.13) sexual assault PBS and 2.74 (SE = 0.19) drinking PBS (Table , Row 8). There was a positive association between within-day changes in willingness and sexual assault PBS use (Row 12), such that at average levels of intentions, each 1-unit increase in willingness was associated with a 0.15 (SE = 0.06) increase in PBS use. In other words, women reported their highest sexual assault PBS use on days when their willingness to use sexual assault PBS increased throughout the day. Within-day changes in intentions to use sexual assault PBS were not significantly associated with sexual assault PBS use (Row 11). There were no significant associations between within-day changes in intentions and willingness and drinking PBS use (Rows 11 and 12). RQ3: Do Event-level Associations Between PBS Use and Decision-theoretical Constructs Vary Based on One's Average Overall Levels of Intentions and Willingness? Sexual Assault PBS Across both models, and consistent with global theories of behavior change (e.g., , the between-person effects of both intentions and willingness to use sexual assault PBS were positively associated with number of PBS used (Table , Rows 2, 3, 9, and 10). Individuals who reported greater intentions and willingness to use sexual assault PBS, on average, also reported using a greater number of sexual assault PBS, compared to individuals who reported lower average intentions and willingness to use sexual assault PBS. Building on this work, RQ3 examined whether event-level associations between PBS use and decision-theoretical constructs vary based on one's average overall levels of intentions and willingness. The between-person by daily average interactions were not significant (Rows 6 and 7), suggesting the non-significant event-level associations described above (RQ1) were consistent across all women in the sample; they did not vary based on one's typical levels of intentions and willingness. However, the between-person by withinday change interaction was significant for willingness to use sexual assault PBS (Row 14), suggesting the positive association between within-day changes in willingness and sexual assault PBS use (RQ2 above) might vary depending on one's typical willingness to use sexual assault PBS. To probe the nature of this interaction, the interaction was graphed in Figure . Separate lines are used to indicate the within-day association among individuals who reported (a) average (mean), (b) above-average (1 SD above the mean), and (c) below-average (1 SD below the mean) levels of overall willingness to use sexual assault PBS. The interaction was further probed by calculating the simple slopes and region of significance for each of the three between-person levels of sexual assault PBS willingness . Women who had average and below-average levels of overall willingness to use sexual assault PBS reported increased sexual assault PBS use on days when their willingness to use those PBS increased throughout the day (p < .01). This association was not significant for women with overall above-average levels of sexual assault PBS willingness; these women used the highest number of sexual assault PBS regardless of any within-day fluctuations in willingness. Drinking PBS. Across both models, the between-person association (Level 2) between willingness to use drinking PBS and PBS use was significant (Table , Rows 3 and 10), suggesting that individuals who, on average, reported willingness to use more drinking PBS also reported using a greater number of drinking PBS over the period of assessment. There was a significant cross-level interaction of between-person by daily average willingness to use drinking PBS (Row 7), suggesting that even though no event-level association between willingness and drinking PBS use was found when we examined main effects (RQ1 above), there may be an event-level association for certain individuals. Further probing (see Figure ) revealed individuals who, on average, reported the lowest overall level of drinking PBS willingness (i.e., below-average) decreased their PBS use on days when they reported more than their typical amount of willingness to use drinking PBS (p < .05). The simple slopes for the other between-person levels of drinking PBS willingness (i.e., average and aboveaverage) trended in the expected direction but were not significant. No other significant interaction effects were observed; intentions did not predict drinking PBS use at any level. Figure Effects of Between-Person Drinking PBS Willingness on the Association Discussion The current study aimed to enhance existing risk reduction programs by examining event-level variability in the decision-making processes that influence PBS use using an EMA study design. First, we examined whether women used more sexual assault and drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so were higher than normal. Findings did not support this hypothesis. This was surprising, as previous work indicates women regularly use a number of sexual assault PBS already , suggesting they are generally aware of social and environmental risks. One notable difference from this prior work was that our study focused solely on women in their first semester of college. These women may still be learning about social and environmental risk factors, suggesting a need to understand how PBS use and motivations for use differ between first year students and their more senior counterparts. At the event-level, specific contextual factors may impact women's risk perceptions and, in turn, their decisions to use sexual assault PBS on a given day. Women tend to be less willing to use sexual assault PBS in situations where they are socializing with someone they know because they do not think of that person as a potential perpetrator . Students may also be less willing to use drinking PBS if they have competing intentions to drink, as drinking PBS focus on limiting alcohol consumption. This effect might be heightened by affiliation with groups that support a heavy drinking culture (e.g., athletic teams, Greek life). Future event-level studies of PBS decision making should examine the role of contextual factors, such as with whom and in what environments women socialize, and between-person differences that might further explain event-level processes. Next, we asked whether women used more sexual assault and drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so increased throughout the day relative to days when their intentions and willingness decreased or stayed the same. Whereas no significant findings were observed for drinking PBS, women reported their highest sexual assault PBS use on days when their willingness to use sexual assault PBS increased throughout the day. This might suggest that women adjust their sexual assault PBS as they coordinate with friends or learn more about their plans through the day (e.g., where they are going, who they will see). Future research should explore what factors impact shifts in sexual assault PBS willingness, as well as between-person differences in who adjusts their willingness and PBS use versus those who do not. Interventions might be enhanced by encouraging women to learn as much as possible about the events they plan to attend (e.g., where they are going, what could happen in that setting) so they can proactively consider which PBS they might be willing to use in each situation. The third research question examined whether event-level associations between PBS use and willingness and intentions varied based on individuals' average levels of willingness and intentions. Consistent with global theories of behavior change and prior PBS-specific studies (e.g., , we did observe significant between-person effects such that women who reported more willingness to use both types of PBS, on average, also endorsed greater use. The between-person effect of intentions was significant for sexual assault PBS only, indicating women who reported higher average intentions were more likely to use PBS such as walking home with a friend. The impact of these between-person effects on event-level decision making varied based on the PBS type. For sexual assault PBS, a significant between-person by within-day change interaction was observed. Women who had below-average and average levels of willingness to use sexual assault PBS reported the highest actual use on days when their willingness to use sexual assault PBS increased; this pattern was not observed for women with above-average levels of overall willingness. Examination of Figure  suggests we may be observing a ceiling effect among above-average sexual assault PBS users. These women are regularly using sexual assault PBS at high rates with little room to increase. Findings suggest women who typically are less willing to use sexual assault PBS may benefit from eventlevel types of intervention to increase their willingness prior to higher risk occasions involving alcohol or potential sexual encounters , and that existing prevention efforts could focus on positively reinforcing the PBS use that is already happening. When examining cross-level interactions for drinking PBS, a different pattern of findings emerged. We observed a significant between-person by daily average interaction for willingness to use drinking PBS; women who tended to have the lowest overall willingness to use drinking PBS actually decreased their drinking PBS use on days when they reported more willingness to use them. There are several possible explanations for this finding that should be explored in future work. Perhaps these women are less successful with implementing these behaviors because they may be less familiar with using them or simply do not like to use them. It is also plausible that despite being more willing to use drinking PBS in advance of a drinking event, they may find themselves in an environment where they perceive none of their peers are using them, or that none of their peers would approve of their use. These women may be particularly affected by both drinking and PBS-specific normative influences . Either way, the findings are somewhat concerning because they highlight a lack of planning to use drinking PBS, and a lack of follow-through even when willingness is high. Interventions may need to strengthen the use of drinking PBS on a global level before event-level interventions are considered, and additional research may be needed to better understand normative influences and barriers associated with drinking PBS use. Notably, intraclass correlations revealed less event-level variability in PBS use than we expected to observe (15% for sexual assault PBS; 22% for drinking PBS), which may highlight several ways in which our study design could be strengthened in subsequent research. First, to minimize participant burden we chose to focus on college students' most commonly used PBS, yet decision-making processes may be different for less common PBS, especially if those are PBS women only use out of necessity (e.g., if a situation escalates and requires forceful physical resistance; . Expanding the number and types of PBS measured may capture the full range of strategies women choose to implement. More nuanced understanding of how women combine PBS and which PBS women use in different contexts would also better inform EMA measurement, and ultimately prevention . Second, post-hoc comparison of EMA participants to a reactivity control group suggested women may have increased PBS use in response to frequent assessment. While this is encouraging when considering the utility of momentary/event-level interventions to increase PBS use, it could have also resulted in reduced variability, or even over-reporting, of PBS use in daily assessments. Finally, we aimed to understand decisions leading up to drinking events, necessarily limiting analysis to drinking days. However, not all sexual assaults involve alcohol, and a woman's decision not to drink on a given day or in a specific context may be an intentional PBS. We may capture more event-level variability by examining a broader range of PBS and decisions to use PBS on both drinking and non-drinking days. Implications for Prevention Previous research has called for the integration and increased use of both sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS to enhance existing sexual assault prevention efforts . By examining women's decisions to use (or not use) PBS on drinking days, the current study serves as an initial step in providing an evidence-based way to help women utilize a ""toolkit"" of strategies that will help them to feel empowered and in control of their environment, while also reducing the likelihood they will be perceived by perpetrators as potential victims. Overwhelmingly, the current study highlights the need to increase intentions to use drinking PBS. Practitioners may consider using existing alcohol risk reduction strategies (e.g., motivational interviewing [MI; ; personalized normative feedback [PNF; ; parent-based intervention [PBI; ) and sexual assault risk reduction programs targeting heavy drinkers (e.g.,  to encourage women to think through common social scenarios and plan for which PBS they would use to minimize potential risk. Conversations that address barriers to using drinking PBS, like competing intentions to drink, might be enhanced by providing alternative strategies that can be used even if intentions to drink are high (e.g., alternating alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages vs. limiting to three or fewer drinks).  have successfully used similar approaches to increase women's use of forceful verbal and physical sexual assault resistance strategies in their Enhanced Assess, Acknowledge, Act (EAAA) program. Findings also revealed that intentions and willingness to use PBS operate at both between-person and within-person levels and may require different strategies to achieve behavior change. To address between-person differences, individuals who are more willing to use PBS may benefit from highlighting successful outcomes from prior PBS use to reinforce positive decisions. Those who are less willing to use PBS may require more intensive efforts to increase their willingness to use PBS, perhaps by first increasing their confidence in their ability to effectively use PBS . A similar approach to target within-person differences might be to reinforce intentions/willingness throughout the day, during an actual drinking event, or even prior to a potential sexual encounter, via text messages or interactive mobile apps. Because women are generally willing to use sexual assault PBS  and may increase use in response to frequent mobile assessment, interventions that reach them in the moments when they need to be used (or immediately before) may increase use during higherrisk occasions. Prevention scientists might consider supplementing efficacious individual-level interventions (e.g., MI, PNF, PBI, EAAA) with adaptive mobile components that aim to increase or maintain high levels of event-level PBS use. Event-level evaluation of PBS use following program exposure would provide valuable insight into how to structure supplemental intervention messaging, while capturing program impacts on PBS use that are not captured using more traditional longitudinal evaluation methods. Finally, practitioners and scientists alike might consider the utility of both sexual assault and drinking PBS in their prevention programs and research. Previous research shows women use more sexual assault PBS on days when they drink . This suggests sexual assault PBS may be particularly appealing and more likely to be used among drinkers. These strategies may enhance alcohol reduction programs' impact on sexual assault outcomes (e.g., . Further, sexual assault risk reduction programs are often sought out by women with prior victimization experience , who may be at increased risk for heavy drinking . Whereas most programs address alcohol as a situational risk factor, more robust discussion of drinking PBS may be useful for these women. Regardless of the setting, discussions of PBS use should be coupled with reminders that these strategies aim to reduce risk, but may not completely eliminate it. It is equally important to highlight that if women experience sexual assault even after using PBS, that does not imply the assault was their fault; sexual assault is always caused by a perpetrator. In a continued effort to shift the responsibility of sexual assault prevention away from potential victims, practitioners should implement both alcohol and sexual assault risk reduction programs in combination with efficacious programs that reduce community-level risk (e.g., bystander intervention;  and perpetration behaviors . Limitations and Future Directions Although careful controls were in place throughout the study, certain limitations remain. Our sample size was sufficient to address the proposed research questions, but findings would be strengthened from replication in a larger, more diverse sample of women who engage in different patterns of drinking (abstainers, light, moderate, and heavy). Including light and non-drinkers in future research would be beneficial considering they may still be at risk when they are in the presence of others who are drinking. Decision-making patterns also should be examined among different groups of students we know to be at increased risk for alcohol-related problems and/or sexual victimization (e.g., LGBTQ, international, racial/ethnic minority and first-generation students; those involved in Greek Life or with a history or prior victimization), as they may have unique prevention needs. Although a significant portion of our sample indicated intentions to join Greek Life, our data do not indicate who actually joined, and we were underpowered for the three-way interactions required to reliably examine group differences. Although EMA compliance was high (>90%), initial response and enrollment rates could be improved, perhaps by offering online/virtual training or higher incentives. To minimize respondent burden, the current study examined a limited set of theoretical constructs (i.e., intentions and willingness). Additional work is needed to examine contextual and intrapersonal decision-making factors (e.g., norms, attitudes, expectancies, perceived situational risk) at the event level to better understand malleable constructs that can be targeted by interventions. Further, we were unable to link PBS use to sexual assault outcomes because there was limited endorsement of unwanted sexual experiences on any of the 14 measured occasions. Although these associations are wellestablished using cross-sectional and non-diary longitudinal designs , linking PBS use and sexual assault outcomes at the event-level would uniquely inform prevention. Such a study would likely require a longer EMA data collection period (e.g., 30 days) and an event-contingent assessment method to capture outcomes tied to specific PBS use. Finally, our data were exclusively self-reported. The intrusive nature of repeated self-report data collection has been identified as a potential source of bias (e.g., reactivity to study procedures) and a threat to ecological validity . This work could be enhanced by incorporating unobtrusive data collection techniques, such as video diaries, biosensors, or geolocation data, which have the potential to eliminate self-report biases, provide robust monitoring of alcohol consumption, and add to our contextual understanding of PBS use (e.g., how decisions to use PBS are made at different levels of intoxication; whether decisions vary across social contexts or physical locations). Conclusion The current study was the first to examine event-level decisions to use both sexual assault and drinking PBS. The findings demonstrated decision-making constructs related to using sexual assault and drinking PBS among college women vary between people and at the event level, and unique intervention approaches may be needed to increase specific types of PBS. Findings from the study also highlight the need for both global and eventlevel intervention approaches to be tailored to women based on their current willingness and intentions to utilize PBS rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.

4,4,Attachment and Borderline Personality Disorder: Differential Effects on Situational Socio-Affective Processes,"Insecure attachment and borderline personality disorder (BPD) are defined by similar affective and interpersonal processes. Individuals diagnosed with BPD, however, represent only a subset of those described as insecurely attached, suggesting that attachment may hold broader relevance for socio-affective functioning. Based on a 21-day ecological momentary assessment protocol in a mixed clinical and community sample (N = 207) oversampled for BPD, we evaluate the discriminant validity of each construct as it influences daily interpersonal interactions. We find that insecure attachment is associated with elevated perceptions of interpersonal disaffiliation and maladaptive strategies for affect regulation, whereas enacted interpersonal hostility is more distinctive for BPD. In a series of sensitivity analyses, we further highlight potential caveats to these findings when studying both constructs concurrently. Together, our results suggest that both insecure attachment and BPD contribute to problematic affective and interpersonal processes, but that they do so at different stages of the unfolding social interaction, which has important implications for their maintenance and treatment.","[""Attachment"", ""Borderline personality disorder"", ""Ambulatory assessment"", ""Multilevel structural equation modeling"", ""Daily socio-affective processes""]",10.1007/s42761-020-00017-7,"progression . However, only a subgroup of those described as insecurely attached develops symptoms of BPD , implicating partially, but not fully, overlapping interpersonal and affective liabilities . To address this issue of conceptual redundancy, we evaluated the shared and distinctive contributions of insecure attachment and BPD features to socio-affective processes that characterize interpersonal interactions in daily life in a mixed clinical and community sample of adults. Attachment theory  provides a conceptual framework to explain how experiences in close relationships contribute to generalized patterns of affect and cognition . Individual differences in attachment are organized along two dimensions-anxiety and avoidance. Theoretically, each attachment orientation is related to a distinct pattern of maladaptive interpersonal and affect-regulatory strategies, both of which increase the likelihood of negative affective experiences . Together, these patterns may be understood as protective efforts to navigate relationships characterized by rejection and inconsistency , a notion that resonates with theories suggesting that core etiological mechanisms of BPD are shaped by an invalidating developmental environment . Research supports the relationship between the two, with ~ 90% of patients diagnosed with BPD being described as insecurely attached . However, because the defining features of BPD overlap conceptually and empirically with outcomes described by attachment theory , this observation appears to be tautological. Yet, insecure attachment is also found in many individuals from nonclinical samples (e.g., . Estimates from community samples suggest that 55-65% of adults are securely attached, whereas 10-15% are avoidantly and 15-20% anxiously attached  with BPD constituting a small subset of those with insecure attachment (i.e., prevalence rates of ~ 1.5% in the general population; . Such epidemiological data support theoretical notions that insecure attachment is a vulnerability factor in the pathogenesis of BPD. However, efforts to arrive at conclusions about how attachment relates to BPD are complicated by methodological issues such as the diversity of attachment measures, the use of heterogeneous samples, and a reliance on crosssectional study designs . As a way to address these limitations, Contemporary Integrative Interpersonal Theory of personality and psychopathology  provides an ideal framework for studying the shared and distinct contributions of insecure attachment and BPD to impairments in socio-affective functioning. Key to interpersonal theory is the assumption that individual differences are reflected in characteristic patterns of affective and behavioral processes arising during social interactions in response to perceived internal (i.e., mental construal) and external (i.e., proximal behavior of others) social cues . Previous work  has established two orthogonal dimensions that organize interpersonal perception and behavior and together form the interpersonal circumplex: agency (i.e., dominance vs. submissiveness) and communion (i.e., affiliation vs. quarrelsomeness). As an integrative model, interpersonal theory encompasses the mental representations central to attachment theory as well as the affective and interpersonal processes that define BPD. It also provides a neutral set of concepts to evaluate how distinct constructs affect the direction and strength of momentary interpersonal and affective processes, allowing investigators to avoid the conceptual circularity and confounding effects inherent in previous studies. In the past, this framework has been applied to study interpersonal patterns in BPD and-to a lesser extent-insecure attachment orientations. For example,  found that perceptions of others' quarrelsome behavior (i.e., dissaffilative behavior) predicted one's own quarrelsomeness and that this association was facilitated by negative affect. Importantly, relative to controls, individuals with a BPD diagnosis were more likely to respond to perceptions of quarrelsomeness with negative affect (although the ensuing link between negative affect and quarrelsome behavior was not specific to BPD). Others have investigated similar processes in BPD, generally demonstrating that individuals with a BPD diagnosis were more likely to perceive others as less benevolent on average, but also to respond to those perceptions with increased negative affect . Studies of insecure attachment and interpersonal processes in everyday life parallel those results.  examined the relationship between attachment and withinperson changes in affect in response to perceptions of an interaction partner's agreeable behavior. Anxious and avoidant attachment orientations both enhanced the link between perceptions of another's less agreeable behavior and negative affect, albeit to different degrees. These specific results are consistent with previous findings suggesting that insecurely attached individuals describe their social interactions to be less satisfying and respond to perceptions of interpersonal coldness with heightened negative affect . Both sets of studies accord with theoretical models of BPD that emphasize sensitivity to rejection or coldness from others . However, they also align with notions of heightened sensitivity to threat cues as described in insecure attachments in nonclinical samples . The goal of the present study was to identify more clearly the shared and specific contributions of each construct to the behavioral and affective processes that may derail social interactions in daily life. To accomplish this aim, we examined the interpersonal and affective patterns relevant to two critical pathways: The momentary elevation of negative affect in response to perceptions of one's interaction partner (interpersonal sensitivity) and the unfolding interpersonal behavioral response (behavioral reactivity). Method All procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh institutional review board (Protocol 12030125). Participants Couples were recruited via flyers posted in psychiatric treatment clinics. Current outpatients were screened by phone for both BPD and any other personality disorder (PD) using the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD  and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems PD Scales . Patients were excluded from enrolling in the study if they met criteria for a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar disorder or psychosis. Although the parent study included a total of 260 participants (i.e., 130 couples), not all participants provided the necessary data for inclusion in our study. Participants were excluded if they did not provide any Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) reports (n = 8), did not provide EMA reports about interpersonal interactions (n = 42), or did not finish reports on interpersonal situations (n = 3). Excluded participants did not differ from included participants on key variables of the study (e.g., age, gender, BPD severity; mean p value > .09). Thus, the final sample size for this study was 207 participants. These participants included slightly more females (54%) than males and were predominantly white (74%). The mean age was 30.5 (SD = 6.8), and n = 43 (21%) met the diagnostic threshold for BPD, with the majority of participants (n = 146, 71%) having at least one criterion. Due to missing data, sample sizes across models vary slightly. Procedure Following the baseline assessment where participants completed clinical interviews and selfreport measures, they received a smartphone equipped with an application devised for this study and instructions for its use. Every day for 3 weeks, records of their setting, situation, mood, and interpersonal behavior were completed following every interpersonal interaction that lasted at least 10 min. As participants submitted responses, data were transferred to a secure database accessible to study staff via a virtual Web server. Enabling access to data in real time allowed study staff to monitor compliance daily. If a participant did not complete at least one interpersonal interaction record per day, study staff called the participant and assessed whether any interpersonal interactions had occurred that day and, if necessary, discussed and solved any technical or motivational issues. Participants were compensated $40 for completion of the interview, and up to $165 for completion of the ambulatory assessment. Rates of compliance were generally good: The average percent of days in which participants completed at least one entry was 84%, with an average of M = 67 interactions per participant. Measures Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised-The Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R)  is a self-report measure of adult attachment that has been used and validated in BPD samples . It consists of 36 items, which measure romantic attachment along two dimensions: avoidance (18 items; for example, I prefer not to show a partner how I feel deep down) and anxiety (18 items; for example, I worry about being abandoned). Participants responded to each item using a 7-point scale from 1 (""strongly disagree"") to 7 (""strongly agree""), rating the extent to which each item is descriptive of how they usually feel and behave in romantic relationships. Ratings were then averaged to compute scores for each dimension. High scores reflected more anxious and avoidant attachment orientations. Internal consistencies of both scales were excellent in our sample, with α = .91 (95% CIs: 0.90; 0.91) for avoidance and α = .93 (95% CIs: 0.93; 0.93) for anxiety. Personality Disorder Features-Participants were interviewed using the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality (SIDP-IV; . Interviewers rated each PD criterion on a scale ranging from 0 to 3. We operationalized BPD features as the dimensional sum of the BPD criteria scores; in a supplementary analysis (Table ), we used the total of the remaining PD criteria as a covariate. To determine interrater agreement, video recordings of the SIDP-IV interviews from a sample of five participants were reviewed and scored independently by seven research team members (intraclass correlations: PD = .97; BPD = .90). Momentary Interpersonal Behavior of Self and Other-The participant's interpersonal behaviors and the participant's perceptions of the other's behavior during the interaction were assessed using the Social Behavior Inventory (SBI; . The SBI is a checklist of 46 behavioral items (rated yes or no) designed to fit the structural model of the interpersonal circumplex used by Contemporary Integrative Interpersonal Theory . In line with , participants responded to a checklist with a subset of 12 items to describe their own behavior during each interaction. These 12 behavioral items measured each of the four poles of the interpersonal circumplex (i.e., dominant vs. submissive; agreeable vs. quarrelsome). From these, we created two subscales corresponding to dominance (Dominance = Dominant -Submissive) and affiliation (Affiliation = Agreeable -Quarrelsome). Prior work has treated the four scales as separate, but we collapsed them based on theoretical grounds, and to reduce number of statistical models/tests, as we have done in our prior work . Participants rated their perceptions of the interaction partner's behaviors on a subset of 7 items that did not vary and that were scored similarly for dominance and affiliation. The proportion of between-person variance, calculated using the intraclass correlation, for the dominance dimension was .12 for perceived and .07 for enacted dominance, and for the affiliation dimension was .16 for perceived and .17 for enacted affiliation. Momentary Affect-Each electronic diary record presented 19 negative affect adjectives on a 5-point scale (1 = very slightly or not at all, 5 = extremely) from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Extended version (PANAS-X; . Analytic Plan We used multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) to test shared and specific contributions of insecure attachment and BPD on socio-affective processes in daily social interactions. MSEM can accommodate momentary events nested within persons and allows for the estimation of random effects (i.e., intercepts and slopes that vary across individuals). MSEM allows for the decomposition of the total variance of each within-person assessed variable into the latent between-person level variance and the within-person level residual variance (Fig. ). This decomposition is done in a standard multilevel model when estimating a random intercept for an outcome/dependent variable, but like with single-level SEM, all variables can be either predictors or outcomes. Thus, in MSEM this latent decomposition is possible for all momentary variables in the model. The advantage is that this flexibility adjusts for differences in reliability of measurement across individuals who provide discrepant numbers of observations. In the current study, the between-person variance reflects individual differences in the observed variables, and the within-person variance reflects situation-to-situation departures from each individual's mean on these variables. Thus, the MSEM used in this study estimates separately the between-person portion of the model, which represents average associations among individual differences in observed variables collapsed across all situations (akin to cross-sectional designs), and the within-person level portion of the model, which represents associations among variables that fluctuate from situation-to-situation. Because all the modeled associations are among concurrently assessed variables and not lagged, this means that the within-person associations reflect situation-to-situation dynamic processes, but they do not directly establish temporal precedence. All models were estimated in Mplus (version 8.3; . Bayesian estimation based on the Gibbs sampler ) was used because it provides a true latent decomposition into within-and between-person variance for both the predictor and outcome variables when random effects are specified. Significance for all model parameters was based on 95% Credibility Intervals (CIs), with CIs that excluded zero indicative of a parameter that differed significantly from zero. Figure  provides a diagram of the two key estimated models. As outlined above, literature suggests that sensitivity to interpersonal threat cues (interpersonal sensitivity) is amplified in BPD and insecure attachment (e.g., . Moreover, hostile behavioral reactivity in response to interpersonal perceptions is a key symptom of BPD, and similar-yet less severe-patterns are also observed in insecurely attached individuals . In model set 1, we examined interpersonal responsivity and behavioral reactivity at the within-person level in an unconditional model with no substantive between-person predictors of individual differences in the within-person paths, thereby serving as a baseline for interpreting subsequent effects. Interpersonal responsivity refers to the prediction of one's own situational behavior by momentary perceptions of other's behavior, and behavioral reactivity to the prediction of one's own momentary behavior by momentary negative affect. At the same time, model set 1 also regressed ratings of momentary negative affect on momentary perceptions of the other's behavior, a path we referred to as interpersonal sensitivity (see Fig.  for an overview of momentary within-person links). Importantly, negative affect was situated as an intervening variable to account for the associations between perceptions of others' and one's own behavior. Within-person regression paths were estimated as randomly varying across individuals. At the between-person level, the average of one's own behavior was regressed on average negative affect and perceptions of others', while negative affect was additionally regressed on perceptions of others'. In a subsequent step (model set 2), we introduced insecure attachment and BPD features as joint moderators of individual differences in all within-person paths, as well as predictors of individual differences in interpersonal perceptions, negative affect, and one's own behavior. To determine the robustness of our analyses, we examined the extent to which our results would be affected by theoretically plausible alterations of the operationalization of betweenperson level effects. These sensitivity analyses are summarized in Table  and detailed in the supplementary files. Full model specifications can be found at https://osf.io/k5pxc/. Model set 2a tested attachment and BPD as between-person predictors in two separate models. This modeling decision is based on the observation that insecure attachment and BPD empirically overlap, and it allowed us to assess each predictor's separate predictive validity. Model set 2b examined the differential contribution of the two attachment dimensions. Therefore, we entered anxious and avoidant attachment independently as between-person predictors in two separate models. Finally, to further isolate the specific effects of anxious or avoidant attachment and BPD, and parse out variance attributable to general interpersonal dysfunction, model set 2c included a covariate that was calculated as the sum of the remaining PD features to adjust for general interpersonal functioning (PD; model set 2c). Sex and age (centered on mean age) were also included as covariates in all models at the between-person level, and observation number (i.e., time centered on mean of observations) was included as a within-person covariate (see  for a similar approach). Coefficients for covariates will not be presented for parsimony. Along with other parameters not reported in the tables (e.g., residual variances), covariances among between-person variables are not depicted in the diagrams, but full specifications and detailed output from all models can be found online at https://osf.io/de246/. Table  summarizes pooled withinperson correlations among the variables along with correlations among the random intercepts at the between-person level. Results Model Set 1: Momentary Socio-Affective Processes We first tested whether perceptions of others' behavior and one's own behavior were associated (i.e., within-person interpersonal responsivity path), and whether negative affect could account for this link. The results of this model are presented on the left side of Table . We found that perceptions of others' lower affiliation significantly predicted higher negative affect (i.e., interpersonal sensitivity within-person path), and higher negative affect significantly predicted lower affiliative behavior (i.e., behavioral reactivity within-person path). The indirect effect was significant, yet the direct association (i.e., interpersonal responsivity within-person path) remained significant as well, suggesting negative affect only partially accounted for the within-person link between perceptions of affiliation and one's own affiliative behavior. When predicting one's own dominant behavior from perceptions of affiliation, we found a significant but modest direct effect, but negative affect did not significantly account for this association. Specifically, though perceptions of less affiliation by others predicted more negative affect (interpersonal sensitivity within-person path) as was the case in the prior model given it is the same path, negative affect did not predict dominant behavior (behavioral reactivity path; right side of Table ). Across both model specifications, significant between-person main effects of perceptions of others' behavior (Perc i ), one's own behavior (Beh i ), and negative affect (NA i ) indicate that those variables varied significantly across participants, suggesting that individual differences (i.e., PD, BPD, insecure attachment) may account for these variation patterns (see model set 2). Model Set 2: Moderation of Momentary Socio-Affective Processes by Insecure Attachment and BPD Next, we tested whether insecure attachment features moderated the three within-person paths described above. Individual differences in the strength of the interpersonal sensitivity, behavioral reactivity, and interpersonal responsivity paths were regressed on insecure attachment features as well as BPD, as were the intercepts of interpersonal perceptions, one's own behavior, and negative affect. Neither insecure attachment nor BPD features had an effect on the interpersonal sensitivity path when both were included in the model. However, both insecure attachment and BPD features moderated the behavioral reactivity within-person path (link between negative affect and affiliative behavior; left side of Table ). Specifically, while insecure attachment dampened the negative association (i.e., made it weaker) between negative affect and affiliative behavior, BPD features amplified this same relationship. In addition, we found that insecure attachment was associated with higher negative affect and perceptions of lower affiliation in others at the between-person level, whereas BPD features were associated with lower affiliative behavior. In addition to those findings, for dominant behavior (right side of Table ), BPD features dampened the positive link between perceptions of other affiliation and dominant behavior (interpersonal responsivity) and amplified dominant behavioral reactivity to negative affect. Sensitivity Analyses To check the robustness and clarify the interpretation of the observed effects, we examined the extent to which results from model 2 were affected by a series of changes in model specification at the between-person level. Model Set 2a To clarify further the nature of effects observed in model 2, we re-ran the model twice, (a) once without the inclusion of BPD symptoms as a predictor and (b) once without the inclusion of insecure attachment (i.e., we ran two separate models). These analyses yielded a significant negative moderation of interpersonal sensitivity by insecure attachment, along with a positive between-person effect on negative affect and a negative between-person effect on perceptions of others' affiliation. Similar, but weaker, effects emerged for BPD for individual differences in negative affect and perception. In addition to these findings, a negative between-person effect on own affiliative behavior emerged, whereas BPD did not moderate any of the three within-person paths outlined in Fig.  (see Table ). For dominant behavior, our analyses yielded a negative moderating effect of insecure attachment on interpersonal sensitivity as with the prior models above, whereas BPD only negatively moderated the path of interpersonal responsivity. Model Set 2b We next examined Model 2 by decomposing insecure attachment into its constituent dimensions of anxiety and avoidance and entering both separately into two independent models. The pattern of results remained largely the same for each dimension of attachment. Anxious and avoidant attachment were positively associated with individual differences in the negative affect, and BPD features evidenced a significant negative between-persons association with affiliative behavior. Both anxious and avoidant attachment orientations positively moderated the link between negative affect and own affiliative behavioral reactivity. BPD, in contrast, had no moderating effect on any of the paths in our model (Table ). For dominant behavior (Table ), we found that BPD amplified the link between negative affect and one's own dominance (i.e., behavioral reactivity) as well as the link between perceived affiliation and dominance (i.e., interpersonal responsivity), but only when entered jointly with avoidant attachment. Model Set 2c After adding all other PD features to our set of predictors, anxious attachment moderated the interpersonal sensitivity path, whereas BPD moderated affiliative behavioral reactivity. When BPD was entered jointly with avoidant attachment, both moderated the behavioral reactivity path, yet in different directions (i.e., avoidant: positively; BPD: negatively). When predicting dominant behavior from perceived affiliation, anxious attachment continued to enhance affiliative interpersonal sensitivity, whereas BPD dampened the interpersonal responsivity link between perceptions of other affiliation and own dominant behavior. When entered together with avoidant attachment orientations, only BPD negatively moderated the interpersonal responsivity link. PD, in contrast, had no additional moderating influence on any of the paths. Also, because it can be argued that the effects of attachment should be most pronounced within the context of situations that activate the attachment system, such as those involving close relationship partners (e.g., , we controlled for interactions occurring between both partners. Moreover, controlling for interactions within couples had no impact on the pattern of results. Note that including the effects of attachment orientation and BPD simultaneously in models reveals their potentially unique effects, but not the effect of their common variance. Thus, to examine the impact of what these constructs share on socio-affective functioning in daily life, we modeled in an exploratory analysis a latent, between-person factor comprising the pooled variance of insecure attachment orientations and BPD features. This analysis revealed a positive between-person effect on negative affect and a significant negative effect on perceptions of the other's affiliative and own affiliative behavior. Neither effects for own dominant behavior nor cross-level interaction effects emerged. Discussion BPD and insecure attachment orientations are characterized by similar socio-affective processes: Patients diagnosed with BPD, but also individuals described as insecurely attached, are inclined to perceive interpersonal situations negatively and exhibit stronger negative affect in response, potentially resulting in maladaptive interpersonal behavioral responses. Using Contemporary Integrative Interpersonal Theory's notion of the interpersonal situation as context , we evaluated the discriminant validity of BPD and attachment for socio-affective processes (interpersonal sensitivity and responsivity, behavioral reactivity) in daily social interactions. Across a series of sensitivity analyses (Table ), BPD features were reliably related to less affiliative interpersonal behavior, whereas insecure attachment was more consistently related to amplified experiences of negative affect in interpersonal situations and less affiliative perceptions of others. Regarding cross-level interactions, the pattern of results was more ambiguous because it varied as a function of modeling decisions. The distinctive outcomes most relevant to BPD features emerged in the context of dominant behavior, where the behavioral reactivity and interpersonal responsivity paths were moderated by BPD. Specifically, the generally negative association between perceived affiliation and dominant behavior was less pronounced in people diagnosed with BPD, whereas the positive link between negative affect and dominant behavior was amplified in the same group. In line with the main effects reported above, the distinctive outcomes most relevant to insecure (particularly anxious) attachment emerged in the interpersonal sensitivity path. However, across sensitivity analyses, this cross-level interaction effect only emerged when insecure attachment was entered as the only predictor, or in combination with general PD features. Overall, our finding that perceptions of others' disaffiliation and negative affect were more strongly pronounced in insecurely attached individuals mirrors previous work by . It is also consistent with theoretical work emphasizing the role of invalidating relationship experiences for the development of heightened emotional sensitivity in BPD . Complementing previous findings by , however, we further demonstrated that when controlling for BPD features, the moderating effect of insecure attachment on the within-person interpersonal sensitivity link disappeared. Across sensitivity analyses, this effect only appeared when insecure attachment was entered without BPD (model 2a), or when controlling for general PD (model 2c). The path most difficult to interpret for both constructs was the within-person disaffiliative behavioral reactivity path (left side of Table ), which was moderated by both insecure attachment and BPD, albeit to different degrees and in different directions. Whereas BPD dampened the association between perceived affiliation and own affiliative behavior, insecure attachment enhanced this link. Because this effect was variable across sensitivity analyses (left side of Table ), it needs to be interpreted with caution. Importantly, the effect did not emerge when we entered insecure attachment or BPD as single predictors. Therefore, it is possible, that when controlling for the overlapping features in each construct, the remaining variance may have caused a spurious suppression effect. However, using a latent variable to isolate BPDs and IAs shared variance only had significant effects on individual differences, not the cross-level interactions. Overall, these supplementary analyses offer further evidence that both insecure attachment and BPD contribute to challenging affective and interpersonal processes, but that they do so at different stages of the unfolding social interaction. Our findings also diverge somewhat from previous work. In contrast to , who reported an effect of BPD features on the relationship between perceived quarrelsome behavior and negative affect, the pattern in our analyses consistently suggests no role of BPD features in moderating that momentary association. Our results may diverge due to methodological differences. For example, we applied a dimensional approach to operationalizing BPD, and Sadikaj et al. ( ) used an extreme-groups design (BPD patients vs. healthy controls). Sampling extremes of the BPD severity distribution leads to the exclusion of its central portions, and the results in enhanced power for statistical tests (e.g., . We acknowledge that sampling may also have had an effect on our results. Our data were drawn from a study designed primarily to study BPD, 43 of the participants met diagnostic threshold for BPD, and others had sub-threshold BPD. Thus, patients in this sample were more prone to dysregulation and insecure forms of attachment than healthy community samples. At the same time, this higher base rate likely increased the power of our analyses to detect meaningful discriminant validity between the constructs. While we view this as a strength, this same study design should be repeated in nonclinical samples. Moreover, for all personality disorders, relationship experiences and enhanced affective reactivity play a significant role in their etiology and maintenance (e.g., . Thus, future studies with distinct (clinical) sample compositions should test the transdiagnostic validity of our results for other psychopathologies. Finally, it is important to note that SIDP-IV questions specifically encourage respondents to talk about usual behaviors and long-term aspects of social functioning by prompting them to ""remember what you are like when you are your usual self."" This emphasis on behavior, in comparison with the emphasis on worries and feelings throughout the ECR-R items, may have amplified the conceptual distinction between the two constructs assessed in this study. Beyond novel insights into key distinctive socio-affective features of attachment and BPD, our research underscores the crucial role that attachment has on the exacerbation and maintenance of BPD. Given the differences in prevalence rates, with BPD accounting for just a fraction of those described as insecurely attached, future research might focus on general processes of modifying relational templates as a potential mechanism for preventing the development of full-blown BPD under circumstances of elevated insecure attachment. In the past, experiences in close relationships have been recognized as putative mechanisms of change . In our study, insecure attachment orientations predicted greater interpersonal negativity and affective dysregulation as well as their association in daily social interactions when  Descriptive statistics and correlations at the between-person and within-person level Model set 1: key coefficients from multilevel models accounted for by negative affect (na)  "
5,5,Capturing emotion coherence in daily life: Using ambulatory physiology measures and ecological momentary assessments to examine within-person associations and individual differences,"While emotion coherence has long been theorized to be a core feature of emotion, to date, studies examining response coherence have been conducted in laboratory settings. The present study used a combined approach of ambulatory physiology measures and ecological momentary assessment conducted over a 4-week period to examine the extent to which emotional experience and physiology show coherence in daily life within-persons; and whether individual differences in response coherence are associated with between-person differences in well-being, negative emotionality, and gender. Results revealed that, on average, individuals exhibited coherence between subjective experience and physiology of emotion, but that there was substantial between-person variation in coherence in daily life. Exploratory analyses revealed no credible link between levels of response coherence and well-being, negative emotionality, or gender. Findings contribute to the literature by demonstrating a novel methodological approach to measuring coherence in daily life and supporting the generalizability of coherence to ecologically valid contexts.","[""Emotion coherence"", ""Emotion concordance"", ""Response coherence"", ""EMA"", ""Well-being""]",10.1016/j.biopsycho.2021.108074,"Introduction Functionalist models of emotion suggest that coherence across physiological, experiential, and behavior response systems supports effective responding to environmental challenges which may, over time, be associated with greater well-being . Although there is disagreement in the literature with respect to average levels of emotion coherence , researchers generally agree that individuals differ in the extent to which they exhibit emotion coherence (also called concordance; . A growing body of work suggests that individual differences in emotion coherence are associated with multiple indicators of adaptive function. Studies have reported associations between greater emotion coherence and subjective well-being , physical health , emotion regulation , and body awareness . However, little is known about the specific processes that contribute to coherence, and very little research has examined the implications of coherence outside of the laboratory setting. The current study utilizes an intensive sampling design incorporating ambulatory measures of autonomic physiology and participant self-reports over a 28-day period to examine whether coherence in emotional arousal is observed in the daily context (i.e., in the absence of experimentally induced affective states), and whether coherence in this context is associated with individual differences in psychological well-being. Researchers have long recognized that emotion is experienced across multiple levels of analysis including physiological (e.g., heart rate), cognitive (e.g., subjective experience), and behavioral manifestations (e. g., facial expression). The most commonly used physiological measures in emotion research are electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate (HR), both of which show rapid dynamic reactivity (on the order of seconds) to emotional stimuli and are proposed to facilitate behavioral actions congruent with the emotion . EDA reflects sympathetic nervous system activity, while HR contains both sympathetic and parasympathetic influence . Manifestations of emotion across these levels of analysis are subjectively experienced as concurrent processes, but researchers have long sought to understand their sequential relation to one another. Early theoretical models proposed that subjective emotional state was induced by a physiological response to a stimulus, thus asserting that coherence between these levels of analysis was a defining quality of emotion . Though some studies of emotion coherence examine coherence between physiology and behavior (e.g., , many studies of emotion coherence frequently examine the extent of association between physiological reactivity and self-reported subjective emotional state in the context of an experimental emotion induction. One study found that emotion induction using both film and music stimuli produced relatively coherent associations between physiology and self-report across 5 basic emotions , although some studies report differences in coherence across emotion categories, with stronger coherence in high-arousal emotion conditions such as fear . Subsequent theoretical models, however, demonstrate that subjective emotional experience is a complex product of physiological signals and cognitive processing of historical and contextual cues that enables one to apply an affective label to their experiential state . In contrast to earlier models, the Schachter-Singer framework proposes that discrete emotions are not bound by unique physiological signatures, but that patterns of physiological arousal could be associated with a range of emotional states that could vary significantly in valence while being similar in arousal (e.g., excitement/anger). Consistent with this framework, research supports associations between physiological arousal and emotional experience, but has failed to identify emotion-specific physiological signatures . Changes in EDA have been shown to reflect general changes in arousal that are not necessarily reflective of emotional valence . In other words, increases in EDA may reflect a change in affective state from a low-arousal emotion (e.g., contentment) to a high-arousal emotion (e.g., excitement) but does not reliably differentiate among high-arousal emotions (e.g. excitement/anger/fear). Similarly, several studies have identified coherence between HR and self-reported arousal . In addition, core affect theories suggest that individual differences in arousal focus-the degree to which one attends to the arousal dimension of affective experience-is linked to greater interoceptive accuracy . These findings are consistent with the supposition that arousal contributes to, but does not dictate the nature of the emotional state, suggesting that coherence between physiology and self-reported specific emotion is not necessarily likely, while coherence between physiology and self-reported arousal may be more in line with prior findings. Component process models of emotion also suggest that response synchronization is an adaptational function of emotion . For example, subjective awareness of arousal may aid in monitoring internal states, underscoring the role of awareness of arousal as part of the multicomponent emotion response. The present study adds to this literature by examining coherence in emotional arousal based on physiology and self-report measures. More recently, research has documented the extent of individual differences in emotion coherence across channels, suggesting that coherence itself may be a meaningful marker of emotional function beyond the extent of emotional reactivity in individual response domains . Indeed, a recent study found that individuals with a higher degree of within-person coherence across physiological and subjective response to a stress condition were characterized by better emotional and physical health . However, the mechanisms through which greater coherence relates to greater well-being have generally not been well-elaborated in the literature, either theoretically, or empirically. Given that most prominent theories of emotion suggest a significant contribution of peripheral physiological activation in the experience and construction of subjective emotion , it is possible that individual differences in emotion coherence arise from individual differences in body attunement. Physiological research indicates that individuals differ in the extent to which they are interoceptively aware . Because awareness of physiological reactivity is an important precursor to emotional labeling  and subjective emotional state , the extent to which individuals are aware of changes in their physiological arousal may be a necessary component of emotional coherence. Indeed, a recent study of individuals high in body awareness found evidence of coherence between heart rate and emotional intensity, where emotional intensity was a measure of the extent of deviation from neutral regardless of the directional valence . Building on this line of work, we propose that the extent of coherence between physiological arousal and subjective arousal awareness is an important component of emotion coherence and examine it in the daily context. Measurement context Examination of emotion coherence further requires consideration of the alignment between the theoretical construct and its measurement. Some researchers have argued that the analytical approaches used in many studies are not appropriate to test the core tenants of emotion coherence (cf. . Specifically, traditional analysis techniques rely on between-person comparisons that assess whether individuals with relatively higher levels of physiological arousal report relatively stronger emotions. This approach does not truly examine emotion dynamics, and whether moments when an individual experiences an increase in physiological arousal are associated with concurrent changes in emotional experience. Studies that have employed a within-person analysis framework have more consistently identified evidence of coherence . However, the extent to which these findings reflect coherence as a generalized trait are limited by the restricted contexts in which coherence is assessed. Specifically, despite the centrality of functionalist theoretical accounts of emotion coherence in the literature , focal hypotheses arising from these theories (e.g. that coherence is adaptive) have been examined exclusively in laboratory settings in the context of experimental manipulations of emotion condition. This context may only provide limited insight into the implications of coherence in daily life. For instance, laboratory conditions establish strong and consistent context cues about the nature of the emotion being induced, whereas typical daily life often requires people to navigate emotional experiences in more ambiguous contexts. In order to advance our understanding of emotion coherence, research needs to examine individuals in naturalistic settings. The advent of new technologies makes possible the measurement of autonomic physiological activity over long intervals and without restrictions on movement or location through the use of wearable devices . Coupled with the ability to deploy psychological surveys directly to the participants' smartphones, researchers are well positioned to examine emotion coherence in everyday life through ecological momentary assessment (EMA; Shiffman, Stone, & Hufford, 2008). EMA studies are generally geared towards learning about life as it is lived by collecting repeated measures on momentary experiences, from many participants. The intensive longitudinal data yielded in EMA studies enables researchers to examine processes at the within-person level by observing the associations between an individual's self-reported emotion and concurrent physiological activity repeatedly over time . Accordingly, utilizing intensive longitudinal data that consists of both subjective self-reported experiences and in-vivo physiological recording provides an opportunity for the measurement of coherence in daily life that may be more representative of normative emotional responding. The present study To advance the knowledge base of coherence in daily life, the present study used EMA data to assess coherence of physiological activity and subject arousal awareness in a sample of adults measured over a 28-day period. A wrist-worn device measured HR and EDA continuously throughout the day, and participants were prompted 6 times per day to complete self-report questionnaires on their own smartphones. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects modeling, cast in Bayesian statistical framework , to (1) determine whether emotion coherence in daily life, in terms of emotional arousal, was evident at the within-person level similar to what has been observed in laboratory/experimental studies, and (2) which physiological channels show coherence with subjective awareness of arousal. HR is a consciously accessible physiological marker that has been consistently examined in research on body awareness and interoception . EDA is also considered a robust marker of affective arousal . Finally, we (3) examined potential between-person moderators of emotion coherence. Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that coherence will be higher among women , and that individuals with higher coherence have higher subjective well-being and lower trait negative emotionality (e.g., . Methods We analyzed data from a larger EMA study that explored people's everyday life experiences, with special focus on psychological wellbeing and the dynamics of emotion. All scripts for data analyses are available via OSF at the following link: https://osf.io/scgev/? view_only=f2aba20f81064ccf87942321d60a0c5d. All procedures were approved by the IRB (protocol #00001017). Participants The sample consisted of twenty-five participants (17 women, 8 men) ranging from 21 to 66 years of age (M = 32.2, SD = 10.40). Participants were recruited from the community adjacent to a large, Northeastern university. The majority of the participants were White (84 %, n = 21) with the remaining participants identifying as Asian (8 %, n = 2) and Latino/a (8 %, n = 2). Procedure After consenting to participate in the study, participants completed a battery of baseline questionnaires consisting of demographic and psychological items. They also provided their phone numbers to the research assistants and were enrolled in SurveySignal text messaging service  for delivery of the daily self-report survey prompts (with a link to a Qualtrics web survey). Participants reported their normal waking hours, and these hours were divided into 6 blocks. Daily surveys were timed so that one survey was delivered during each time block, and no two surveys were delivered within half an hour of one another. These surveys were prompted 6 times each day for 28 days, and consisted of items related to core affect (valence and arousal), love, meaning of life, accomplishment, and flow. Surveys expired after 60 min to ensure participant compliance within the specified time window. Current analyses focus on the single item assessing self-reported momentary arousal. Participants received payment in accordance with their response rates to EMA prompts and could earn a maximum payment of $200. 1. Psychological well-being. The PERMA-Profiler  was used to quantify five elements of psychological well-being, namely: positive emotion, engagement, relationship satisfaction, meaning of life, and accomplishment, based on  theoretical model. The PERMA-Profiler captures the five PERMA elements as trait-level factors using three items each, such as ""In general, how often do you feel joyful?"" for positive emotion. Items are rated on a Likert scale from 0 = Never to 10 = Always. In the current study, the mean across all domains was taken to represent a single, well-being composite score, with a possible range of 0-10. The PERMA-Profiler has exhibited high internal consistency in prior work , and in the present study (Cronbach's alpha = 0.95). Scores in our sample ranged from 4.56 to 9.56 (M = 7.72; SD = 1.35), and were sample-mean centered to facilitate multilevel modeling. Apparatus Negative emotionality. The PERMA-Profiler was also used to quantify negative emotionality, via three items: ""In general, how often do you feel sad?"", ""In general, how often do you feel anxious?"", and ""In general, how often do you feel angry?"". Items were rated using the same scale as noted above and were averaged across items to create a total score, with a possible range of 0-10. Scores in our sample ranged from 2.00 to 7.67 (M = 4.17; SD = 1.68). Scores were sample-mean centered to facilitate multilevel analyses. Cronbach's alpha was 0.74. Daily measures 3.3.2.1. Self-reported momentary arousal. At each of the 6 daily prompts participants were asked ""How awake/active do you feel right now?"" This item was rated on a visual sliding scale from 0 = Not at all to 100 = Extremely. The overall mean level of arousal across the sample was 69.17 (SD = 13.86).  was used to collect physiological measures of interest, heart rate and electrodermal activity, throughout the 4-week data collection period. Details of collection are described below. Physiological indices of arousal. The Empatica E4 wristband Heart rate (HR). Heart rate estimated from blood volume pulse (BVP) was measured using a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor mounted on the underside of the E4 watch. The E4 PPG sensor uses green and red light. Both the green and red LEDs are oriented towards the skin and absorbed by the blood in different ways, and are combined to optimize maximizing the estimation of heart rate . Measured light during green exposure contains most of the information on HR and is characterized by a sequence of valleys, whose time occurrences are used to estimate the heart beats. Measured light during red exposure contains a reference light level which is used to cancel motion artifacts. Changes in pulse rate are linearly related to the timing of individual heart beats, and are therefore used to estimate HR . BVP was sampled at 64 Hz and a second-by-second estimate of HR was generated for analysis. The overall mean heart rate across the sample was 83.99 (SD = 4.04). Electrodermal activity (EDA). Electrodermal activity was derived from a sensor made of two aluminum nodes mounted on the wristband and resting on the palmar side of the wrist. Changes in electrical potential across the nodes reflect fluctuations in cutaneous sweat glands, which are innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. EDA was sampled at 4 Hz, and a second-by-second time series of EDA level measured in μSiemens was generated for analysis. The overall mean EDA level across the sample was 1.96 (SD = 2.19). Data processing To facilitate alignment with the EMA data, the physiological data streams were downloaded from the Empatica cloud platform and processed using R version 3.6.0 and R Studio version 1.2.1335 (R Core Team, 2019; R Studio Team, 2020). Data processing was performed using the data.table, lubridate, plyr, and zoo packages . First, we filtered out occasions based on physiologically invalid temperature or heart rate data, specifying the same parameters used by . Specifically, we excluded any occasions where the value for temperature was less than 30 degrees Celsius or greater than 43 degrees Celsius, or where the value for heart rate was less than 30 beats per minute or greater than 200 beats per minute. We then isolated the 1-min segment of physiological data immediately preceding the EMA prompt and calculated the arithmetic mean over the entire minute. If valid physiological data were not available for the entire 1-min interval, that interval was treated as missing. Compliance was satisfactory both in terms of E4 wear time and selfreported survey responses. Across the study period, on average, participants reported arousal levels for M = 157.20 (93.57 %) of the EMA prompts they received (SD = 8.39, min = 129, max = 166). We consider missing physiological data only in reference to occasions where EMA data were provided. Across the study period, on average, 122.25 (77.41 %) of EMA prompts responded to by participants had valid physiological data in the 1-minute interval prior to the EMA prompt (SD = 23.77, min = 80, max = 152). On average, participants had complete EMA and physiological data for M = 122.03 (72.64 %) (SD = 23.84, min = 80, max = 152) of the 168 total possible occasions designated by the study protocol. Data analysis All analyses were performed in R version 4.0.0 and R Studio version 1.2.5042 (R Core Team, 2020; R Studio Team, 2020) using the brms package . The brms package implements parameter estimation in the Bayesian framework by calling Stan software . To facilitate analysis of within-person covariation, the processed EDA and HR data were person-mean centered. Specifically, for each person we calculated the mean value of their EDA and HR scores across all occasions preceding an EMA. Then the person-level mean for each marker was subtracted from each raw score for that marker, yielding scores reflecting whether the person's EDA or HR was higher (positive values) or lower (negative values) than their usual on that specific occasion. To answer our research questions of whether coherence between arousal and physiological indices is evident at the daily level, and whether these associations vary based on person-level characteristics, we chose a linear mixed-effects modeling approach fit in the Bayesian framework. This approach enables the ability to examine within-person associations of two variables (self-reports and physiology) while allowing for between person differences in the intercept and slope and inclusion of predictors of between-person differences (well-being, negative emotionality, and gender). A comparable method has been used to assess coherence between physiology and self-reports of emotion in prior work to accommodate time-series data where the self-reports of emotion may not map on to the precise timing of peak physiological arousal . We opted for implementing the models in the Bayesian statistical framework as it is computationally more stable with small sample sizes. In the Bayesian framework we were able to fit the fully specified random effects structure to our data, which was not possible when we attempted to fit the model in the frequentist framework. Failure to include a random slope in the model due to model non-convergence would have meant that the strength of concordance between physiological arousal and self-report arousal could not vary across persons in the sample, which is often not a tenable assumption. In the Bayesian framework, prior probability distributions on the model parameters need to be selected, and may vary in how informative they are-that is, how much influence they have on the result. In our analyses, we used the default priors in the brms package, which are meant to be weakly informative (i.e., they provide a rough scale to the model; . First, we specified base models without person-level predictors to test whether there was coherence between self-reported and physiological arousal indicators. These models were specified as follows: Arousal it = β 0i + β 1i HR it + ε it and Arousal it = β 0i + β 1i EDA it + ε it where β 0i = γ 00 + u 0i β 1i = γ 10 + u 1i where γ 00 is the fixed intercept, representing the average expected level of self-reported arousal in the sample; u 0i is the random effect for the intercept, representing the extent of between-person variability in that intercept; γ 10 is the fixed slope for the physiological variable (EDA or HR) and represents the average effect for individuals in the sample; u 1i is the random effect for the slope, representing the extent of betweenperson variability in the slope of the physiological variable; and ε it stands for some zero mean residual error. We then added person-level predictors, namely well-being, negative emotionality, and gender, into the model in order to assess the extent to which these variables influence both self-reported arousal and coherence between physiological and self-reports of arousal. Arousal it = β 0i + β 1i HR it + ε it and Arousal it = β 0i + β 1i EDA it + ε it where β 0i = γ 00 + γ 01 WellBeing i + γ 02 NegEmotion i + γ 03 Gender i + u 0i β 1i = γ 10 + γ 20 WellBeing i + γ 30 NegEmotion i + γ 40 Gender i + u 1i where γ 01 , γ 02 , and γ 03 represent the main effects of well-being, negative emotionality, and gender, respectively, on arousal; γ 20 , γ 30 , and γ 40 represent the cross-level interactions of well-being, negative emotionality, and gender, respectively, with the physiological variables. The rest of the terms are as defined for the equations above. The interaction effects indicate the extent to which these between-person variables are associated with the within-person coherence between physiological and self-reported arousal. Missing values for one or more predictors on a given occasion are often handled through listwise deletion in a multilevel modeling framework, regardless of whether the model is fit using frequentist or Bayesian statistics. Data were not imputed prior to or during model fitting because we did not have reason to suspect that values were not missing at random in these data. As an assumption check, we calculated the intraclass correlation (ICC) for self-reported arousal to ensure that there was sufficient variability at both the within-and the between-person levels. The ICC was about 0.34, indicating that 34 % of the variation in arousal is due to between-person differences, which leaves the remaining 66 % at the within-person level. We consider this sufficient to continue multilevel modeling on these data. We hypothesized that the physiological measures would be positively associated with self-reported arousal. We further expected that the cross-level interactions would be significant such that higher coherence (or a stronger positive relationship) between the physiological measures and the self-reports of arousal would be associated with greater psychological well-being, lower negative emotionality, and gender (women higher) at the person level. Due to the small sample size to detect between-person effects, the inclusion of person-level predictors is purely exploratory. Results Coherence between heart rate and self-reports Coefficient estimates for the base model estimating the withinperson relationships between HR and self-reported arousal are shown in Table . Model parameters were estimated by calculating distributions that give the most probable values of these parameters, using Monte Carlo algorithms that sample random values from them. These distributions are called posterior distributions and they combine information from the priors (see defined above) and the likelihood function of the data. Two chains of samples, each updating the results of the previous sample, were run, using different starting values. The first 2000 samples from each chain were used to ""warm up"" the sampling algorithm and were discarded afterwards. Another 5000 were run in each chain after warm-up, and these 10,000 samples were used to estimate the mean for a point estimate (shown in column 2), the standard error (based on the standard deviation of the posteriors, column 3) and the lower and upper limits of the central 95 % credible interval (column 4). The true parameter falls in this credible interval with 95 % probability. The intercept, describing the expected level of arousal at a self-report survey for a perfectly average person when all predictors are at mean levels, is just over 70 (γ 00HR = 70.07, SE = 2.93) on a scale from 0 to 100. Between-person differences in this expected level had a standard deviation of just under 15 (u 0iHR = 14.90; SE = 2.32). More importantly, in line with our hypotheses, results revealed coherence between HR and self-reported arousal, such that when individuals experienced elevated heart rate in the one-minute period prior to the EMA survey, they tended to report higher levels of arousal (γ 10HR = 0.23; SE = 0.04). The strength of this association varied between participants (u 1iHR = 0.17; SE = 0.04), as depicted in Fig. . Person-mean centering focuses the plot on the differing within-person associations between physiological and selfreported arousal and does not provide a visualization of between-person variability in the intercept for arousal. Lines with steeper slopes indicate that, for some individuals, this association is much stronger. Lines with shallower slopes indicate that, for some individuals, this association is much weaker. In other words, for some participants, a given increase in physiological arousal results in a greater change in self-reported arousal, while in others the same increase results in a smaller change in selfreported arousal. Next, we added well-being, negative emotionality, and gender to the model in order to examine whether coherence between HR and selfreported arousal was moderated by these person-level predictors. In the full model (Table ), coherence between HR and self-reported arousal was evident even after accounting for person-level predictors (γ 10HR = 0.26; SE = 0.05). There was also a main effect of person-level psychological well-being on arousal, such that individuals with higher levels of psychological well-being generally had higher momentary selfreports of arousal (γ 01HR = 7.78; SE = 1.99). There were no main effects for negative emotionality or gender on self-reported arousal. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find a credible effect on psychological wellbeing on the strength of HR coherence (γ 20HR = − 0.05; SE = 0.04). In addition, there were no credible interaction effects for negative emotionality or gender on the relationship between HR and selfreported arousal (see Table ).   Note. N = 25; CI = 95 % Credible Interval. HR = heart rate. Coherence between electrodermal activity and self-reports Results for the base model estimating the within-person relationships between EDA and self-reported arousal are shown in Table . Similar to the HR models, the intercept was just under 70 (γ 00EDA = 69.87; SE = 2.93), with a standard deviation of just under 15 (u 0iEDA = 14.77; SE = 2.36). Regarding coherence between EDA and self-reported arousal, results revealed that there was a credible association between within-person changes in EDA and self-reports of arousal, such that when individuals' EDA levels were higher than average in the oneminute period prior to the EMA survey, they reported higher levels of arousal (γ 10EDA = 0.68; SE = 0.23). In addition, the strength of this association varied between participants (u 1iEDA = 0.81; SE = 0.22), suggesting substantial individual differences in coherence (Fig. ). To examine whether coherence between self-reported arousal and EDA was moderated by person-level predictors, we added well-being, negative emotionality, and gender to the model. Results (Table ) revealed that after controlling for covariates, evidence of coherence between EDA and self-report arousal remained credible (γ 10EDA = 0.81; SE = 0.28). Consistent with the HR models, there was also a main effect of person-level psychological well-being on arousal, such that individuals with higher levels of psychological well-being had higher momentary self-reports of arousal (γ 01EDA = 7.79; SE = 2.00). There were no main effects for negative emotionality or gender on selfreported arousal. Finally, we did not find credible effects of psychological well-being, negative emotionality, or gender on the strength of EDA coherence. Discussion The present study examined whether coherence between physiological arousal and the subjective experience of arousal can be found in daily life. We used ecologically valid EMA methodology, including smartphone based self-report surveys to assess momentary arousal levels and second-by-second, unobtrusive, in-vivo physiological recording to assess concurrent physiological markers of affective arousal. Results indicated that individuals, on average, displayed coherence between physiology and subjective experience of arousal. Furthermore, findings were consistent across both HR and EDA, suggesting that coherence may manifest in both channels. In addition, we examined whether hypothesized individual differences in between-person baseline factors are related to daily coherence. Our study presents the first analysis of emotion coherence in daily life, and adds to the literature by providing preliminary support that coherence does occur outside of the laboratory in ecologically valid contexts that aim to capture the normative range of emotions and emotional intensity that individuals typically experience. The use of an ecological momentary assessment design allowed us to collect information on people's affective states throughout the course of their normal, daily life, thereby capturing our measures of coherence in a naturalistic setting . Findings dovetail with prior literature that shows evidence of physiology-experience coherence in lab settings , and extends these findings to daily life. Importantly, there were substantial between-person differences in coherence captured in daily life, as evidenced by the random slopes in our models. This suggests that, while on average, individuals display coherence between physiology and self-reports of arousal, there remains a great degree of variation in the extent to which individuals exhibit coherence. By adding cross-level interactions into our model, we sought to attribute this variation in the extent to which individuals experience coherence to certain person-level variables which prior literature suggests to be theoretically important. Accordingly, we tested associations of between individual differences in the degree of coherence in daily life and three person-level predictors that have been associated with coherence in previous studies: well-being, negative emotionality, and gender . It should be noted that given our small sample size, these analyses can be considered as exploratory and should be followed up on in research using larger samples. In our analyses, no evidence of moderation by any of these factors emerged, and as a result, we cannot attribute the variation in the random slopes to these factors in our study. This may relate to the power of the sample to detect between-person   Note. N = 25; CI = 95 % Credible Interval. EDA = electrodermal activity. differences. The study was designed to maximize power to test within-person coherence in daily life, with t = 168 planned repeated measures per person. However, the small number of participants limits power to detect between person effects (N = 25). This is especially the case for gender, as there were only were n = 8 men in our sample. In the Bayesian framework, although we are able to estimate the full random effects structure, we still have limited power to detect between-person differences in associations. It is also possible that our ability to find an association between traitlevel well-being and negative emotionality was limited by the chosen measurements of these constructs. For example, prior work has examined coherence in relation to the Ryff well-being scale , life satisfaction , depression , and Big-Five neuroticism . We used a multi-dimensional measure of well-being, namely, the PERMA index, along with the PERMA scale of negative emotionality, which is relatively similar theoretically to other measures of well-being used in prior research on coherence (e.g., Ryff well-being scale; . However, it is possible that the PERMA indices of well-being tap into a different construct than measured in prior research. To examine this idea, the analysis was repeated with additional measures of well-being: the Satisfaction with Life Scale  and the SF-36 Emotional Well-Being subscale . Results (included in supplemental material) were largely consistent with our findings using PERMA. This disagreement with the literature suggests that coherence in the context of daily life may not have immediate implications for well-being, or at least that its impact on well-being is nonlinear; although further research is needed to examine whether these results generalize to larger samples. Measurement of coherence in the daily-life context captures a much broader picture of emotion coherence than a laboratory-based assessment. Lab-based studies of coherence tend to measure specific emotional states, typically experiences of strong negative affect designed to assess reactivity to more extreme emotional experiences (e.g., anger; fear). The extent to which individuals feel these more extreme emotions in daily life is unclear. By assessing individuals across 28 days, we maximize the probability of capturing a wide range of emotional experiences, but also include experiences of mild emotional intensity. It is possible that coherence across the full gradient of emotional intensity is not related to psychological well-being, but rather only the extent to which individuals experience emotional coherence in the context of more aversive, more intense, or less ambiguous emotional experiences reflects an adaptive emotional process. It is also possible that the adaptive value of coherence varies situationally. The notion that coherence across emotion channels is inherently adaptive may be incongruent with models of emotion regulation that promote an active decoupling between physiological reactivity and subjective state through cognitive reappraisal , and/or between physiological reactivity and behavior through inhibitory control . It may be that daily life contexts require flexibility in emotion coherence such that well-being is promoted when individuals' coherence is situationally appropriate, with the ability to decouple emotion across levels when needed. For instance, in a laboratory setting, emotion induction is frequently achieved through watching a film-a context in which the circumstances are not personally-relevant and require no behavioral response. Coherence in this setting may reflect an adaptive attunement to one's emotional experiences. In daily contexts, individuals are often called upon to behave in ways that are potentially incongruent with their emotional state, such as being nice to a co-worker that has made them angry or smiling through a job interview despite being nervous. It may be adaptive in these situations for one to be less attuned to their physiological arousal in order to regulate their emotional experience. Future EMA studies could collect more contextual information in order to examine the conditions in which greater coherence is or is not beneficial. It is worth noting that there may additionally be between-person moderators of the extent to which coherence is associated with wellbeing. Some research indicates that emotion coherence may be moderated by cultural factors that may shape participants' emotional display norms, labeling of physiological states, or willingness to disclose subjective emotional state in ways that lead to discontinuity between physiological responses to emotion conditions and the behavioral and subjective manifestations of emotion . These cultural effects suggest that coherence may be associated with well-being only in cultural environments where emotional expression is valued and accepted, whereas less coherence may be more adaptive in cultural contexts where expression is discouraged. Thus, future research could examine the extent to which individuals' identities and beliefs about emotional expression (e.g., belief that ""boys shouldn't cry"") moderate the extent to which coherence has adaptive implications. Researchers have argued for the need for psychophysiological research to attend to the effects of factors like culture and gender in moderating how physiological processes relate to psychological function rather than presuming that findings generalize to all humans (Gatzke-Kopp, 2016). Finally, it is possible that daily coherence may be linked to daily measures of well-being, rather than trait-based measures of well-being. In laboratory settings participants typically complete the trait-based questionnaire on the same day that coherence is assessed, whereas in our study, participants completed a baseline measure, and were then followed for 28 days. Although trait-based well-being measures ask participants to provide ratings that capture how they feel ""in general"", research has found that purportedly stable constructs, such as life satisfaction, can demonstrate considerable short-term variability . Thus, the measurement of momentary well-being and negative emotionality would be a fruitful avenue for future research on daily coherence, as well as further consideration of what functional outcomes of adaptation may be most relevant for daily coherence per theoretical accounts. Taken together, our findings suggest that coherence between physiology and self-reports of arousal can be measured in daily life, and that coherence may be evident in more ecologically valid settings, thereby extending lab-based coherence research to the daily arena. Furthermore, there was some evidence for individual variation in coherence, underscoring the importance of continued research to identify what individual difference factors may account for these differences, and how individual differences in coherence at the daily level may impact functional outcomes. Limitations and future directions Our study presents with several strengths, including high power detect within-person effects, the use of an ecologically valid design, and in-vivo physiological recording to capture coherence in daily life. Nonetheless, several limitations warrant mention. First, although we had a large sample size to test our main hypothesis about coherence within-persons, our between-person sample size was small, limiting our power to detect between-person effects. Thus, it is possible that future studies with larger sample sizes may be able to identify moderation of coherence by well-being, negative emotionality, or gender, as has been found in prior lab studies (e.g., . Second, although the use of wearable physiology sensors enabled us to test our hypotheses in an ecologically valid manner, levels of physiological activity recorded with wearable devices do differ from activity recorded with standard laboratory equipment , and may have accounted for the discrepancies with previous studies. Further, the use of self-reported arousal as our emotion measure limits our ability to test whether findings would generalize to specific affective experiences (e.g., anger; sadness) in daily life. In addition, the use of a one-item measure to assess the subjective experience of arousal via self-reports= can be a double-edged sword-while it has the advantage of increasing participant compliance, it may have limited reliability. Finally, measures of HR and EDA do not by themselves provide insight into emotional processes such as valence, motivational orientation, or mental effort. Accordingly, our conclusions regarding coherence are limited to the arousal dimension of affective responses. Limitations notwithstanding, our study provides a novel contribution to the literature by testing coherence in daily life in an ecologically valid manner. Conclusion The present study utilized ambulatory physiological measures and ecological momentary assessment conducted over a 4-week period to examine the extent to which emotional experience and physiology covary in daily life, and whether individual differences moderate this relationship. Results revealed that, on average, individuals exhibited coherence between subjective experience of emotional arousal and physiology, but there was significant between-person variation in the extent of this coherence. However, we were not able to credibly link the variation in coherence to individual differences in well-being, negative emotionality, or gender. Findings contribute to the literature by providing a novel methodological approach to measuring coherence in daily life and add credence to theoretical accounts of emotion coherence by demonstrating the generalizability of coherence to the daily context. Future research should continue to build on this work by examining between-person effects in larger samples, corroborating daily measures with lab measures, and measuring specific affective states.

6,6,Characterizing nicotine exposure among a community sample of non-daily smokers in the United States,"Background: Over one-quarter of all smokers in the United States identify as non-daily smokers and this number is projected to rise. Unlike daily smokers who typically maintain consistent levels of nicotine exposure with regular smoking, non-daily smokers have variable patterns of smoking that likely result in high intraindividual variability in nicotine intake. The current study aimed to characterize the weekly intraindividual variability in cotinine and identify smoking-related predictors in nondaily smokers. Methods: An ecological momentary assessment of 60 non-daily smokers ages 24-57 years was conducted over a consecutive 7-day at-home protocol to log each smoking session, assessments of mood and social activity during smoking, and collection of daily saliva samples in a convenience sample from Pennsylvania, USA. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the effects of smoking characteristics on total cotinine exposure measured by pharmacokinetic area under the curve and the range, maximum, and minimum cotinine values during the week controlling for demographic variables. Results: The mean daily cotinine level was 119.2 ng/ml (SD = 168.9) with individual values that ranged from nondetectable to 949.6 ng/ml. Menthol predicted increased total cotinine levels (P < 0.05). Shorter time to the first cigarette of the day predicted significantly higher minimum (P < 0.05), maximum (P < 0.05), and total cotinine values (P < 0.05) after controlling for covariates. Negative emotions and social interactions with others were also significantly associated with higher cotinine metrics. There was no significant effect of the nicotine metabolite ratio.Conclusions: Our findings highlight the variability in nicotine exposure across days among non-daily smokers and point to the role of smoking context in nicotine exposure. The findings suggest the need to develop better assessment methods to determine health and dependence risk and personalized cessation interventions for this heterogeneous and growing group of smokers.","[""Non-daily smokers"", ""Nicotine exposure"", ""Nicotine dependence"", ""Cotinine"", ""Smoking behavior""]",10.1186/s12889-021-11052-9,"Background In the United States, the prevalence of cigarette smoking decreased from 21% in 2005 to 14% in 2017 . Accordingly, the number of non-daily smokers is expected to rise as tobacco use becomes more expensive and restricted in the U. S . Approximately one-quarter to one-third of all smokers in the U.S. identify as non-daily smokers who do not smoke a cigarette every day . While non-daily smoking is linked to fewer health risks than daily smoking, non-daily smokers still have substantially higher rates of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease than the general population . National trends suggest that low frequency smokers are becoming more nicotine dependent than in the past, possibly because this group comprises former heavy smokers . A large national survey found that non-daily smokers were more likely to make a quit attempt and maintain abstinence at 90 days than daily smokers . However, the rates of abstinence for non-daily smokers with and without a prior history of daily smoking are still quite low, 27 and 18% respectively, especially considering that approximately half of non-daily smokers are not nicotine dependent . Thus, non-daily use still puts smokers at risk for adverse health outcomes. Nicotine is the primary psychoactive component in cigarettes and the main driver of cigarette dependence . Although nicotine itself is not carcinogenic and makes only minor contributions to the development of cardiovascular disease, nicotine exposure can serve as a biomarker of negative health outcomes since it increases in parallel with other toxins and chemicals in cigarette smoke . Nicotine, and its metabolite cotinine, can be measured in blood, saliva, and urine, making it an accessible and reliable predictor of disease risk and dependence . Despite the rising prevalence of non-daily smoking in the U.S., we still know little about the levels, consistency, and correlates of nicotine exposure for non-daily smokers. One study sampled urinary cotinine at a single time point and found levels to be nearly three times lower among nondaily (aka., intermittent) compared to daily smokers . The amount of exposure per cigarette was similar for daily and non-daily smokers in this study . Not surprisingly, non-daily smokers have lower levels of nicotine dependence than daily smokers . This finding has been replicated across different facets of dependence, including behavioral measures of dependence such as smoking motives, and self-perceived loss of autonomy over smoking . Given the lower levels of nicotine exposure, smoking for non-daily smokers may be even more dependent on environmental and internal stimuli such as mood, activity, and social setting than for daily smokers . Our previous report using ecological momentary assessments among non-daily smokers found that smoking was most likely to occur during positive moods and leisure activities compared to negative and neutral mood states or performative and social activities . Smoke intake, however, is not the only determinant of nicotine exposure for smokers. For example, compared to white smokers, black smokers have higher nicotine metabolite levels per cigarette . This racial difference becomes even more pronounced with fewer cigarettes smoked per day . A similar effect has also been found for menthol compared to regular tobacco smokers . Even mood state, such as positive affect, has been linked to increased nicotine boosts during cigarette smoking . We still have a limited understanding of what factors influence nicotine exposure for non-daily smokers, and if nicotine exposure is moderated by demographic and smoking factors, like race and flavor preference, as it is for daily smokers. Unlike daily smokers that typically maintain consistent levels of blood nicotine to avoid withdrawal symptoms, non-daily smokers report a wide range in the number of cigarettes they smoke per day and the number of days of abstinence between smoking days . Thus, non-daily smokers are a heterogeneous group that may have high variability in their day-to-day nicotine exposure . In other words, the cotinine value on one day may be considerably different to the value on another day. Therefore, it is important to study intraindividual differences in nicotine exposure, including total exposure and consistency in exposure across time, to obtain an accurate picture of nicotine exposure for non-daily smokers. Our primary aims for the current study were to: 1) characterize the intraindividual variability in nicotine exposure for non-daily smokers, and 2) identify demographic and smoking factors associated with nicotine exposure for non-daily smokers. To accomplish these aims, we measured salivary cotinine from non-daily smokers over a 7 day collection period. While mean level of daily nicotine exposure is a meaningful metric for understanding true nicotine exposure for daily smokers, non-daily smokers, on the other hand, likely have more variability in day-to-day nicotine exposure. A one time single day measure of cotinine not only fails to capture the day-to-day variability, but may also provide an inaccurate view of the true nicotine exposure by not accounting for days when no cigarettes were smoked. To overcome this challenge, we used four different metrics to characterize intraindividual differences in nicotine exposure, including area under the curve (AUC) to capture total weekly exposure, maximum and minimum daily values to capture level of exposure on any 1 day, and the range of daily values to measure consistency of exposure across days. We then identified demographic, smoking, and contextual-related correlates of nicotine exposure to explore potential predictors and outcomes of tobacco exposure for non-daily smokers. Methods Participant recruitment Non-daily smokers (n = 60) in the United States were recruited as a sub-sample of the Pennsylvania Adult Smoking Study (PASS) . The PASS study investigated whether socioeconomic status predicts smoke exposure in daily smokers , and the current sub-study was designed to observe factors related to smoking for non-daily smokers specifically. Online advertisements, flyers, and peer-referrals were used for recruitment from 2014 to 2015. Participants were eligible if they reported smoking 4-24 days out of the past 30, and had this pattern for at least 6 months. Interested individuals were excluded if they reported that > 50% of their tobacco use was a product other than a cigarette, were currently pregnant, or engaged in active cessation attempts. Procedures If eligible after phone screening, participants were invited to an initial in-person visit where they provided written informed consent and completed a battery of questionnaires that included measures of nicotine dependence. During a 7-day at-home protocol, participants completed daily smoking logs, measures of smoking topography, ecological momentary assessments (EMA) during each smoking session (described below), and collected one saliva sample at approximately the same time each day for nicotine metabolite analysis. Participants returned all logs, topography equipment, and saliva samples at a final visit following the 7-day collection period. Topography data is not presented in this manuscript and a thorough description of the emotions and activities reported using EMA during each cigarette session has been published . REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) tools hosted at the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center and College of Medicine were used for all data collection and management . All study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Penn State College of Medicine (037860EP). Salivary cotinine Participants provided daily saliva samples for nicotine metabolite analysis. Cotinine has a longer half-life compared to nicotine, approximately 16 h for cotinine versus 2 h for nicotine, making it a sensitive measure of smoking even among light and non-daily smokers . For daily saliva collection, participants placed a SalivaBio Oral Swab (Salimetrics, State College, Pennsylvania) under their tongues for 2 min. Participants stored the swabs in their home freezer until the final data collection visit. Swabs were kept frozen (− 80 °C) in the laboratory until High Sensitivity Salivary Cotinine Quantitative Enzyme Immunoassay (ELISA; Salimetrics, State College, Pennsylvania) was carried out as directed by the manufacturer for the total sample. For 17 participants, immunoassay results were compared to assays conducted using mass spectrometry methods previously described  and modified for increased dilution in saliva samples using Triple TOF 5600 (AB SCIEX, Concord, Ontario, Canada). The same mass spectrometry methods were used to calculate cotinine and trans-3′-hydroxycotinine (3HC) on each participant's initial saliva sample to determine nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), calculated as 3HC divided by cotinine. Continuous NMR values were log transformed for analysis. Similar to previous studies, participants in the lowest quartile of NMR values (≤0.31) were categorized as slow metabolizers and those in the top three quartiles as normal metabolizers . To determine the reliability of cotinine over the course of a single day for non-daily smokers, six participants provided four extra saliva samples (5 total) three to four hours apart on 1 day. These were analyzed using immunoassay. Baseline assessment Participants provided basic demographic information and detailed smoking histories. Those who answered ""yes"" to the question ""Have you ever smoked daily for 6 months or longer?"" were categorized as a ""converted"" non-daily smoker (i.e., converted to non-daily smoking from daily smoking) and those who answered no were categorized as a ""native"" non-daily smoker, as has been done in prior research . The Hooked on Nicotine Checklist (HONC) measured loss of perceived autonomy over smoking using 10-items that assess past recall of withdrawal, craving, and quit attempts (e.g., Do you ever have strong cravings to smoke?) . HONC scores range from 0 (low) to 10 (high) and internal consistency was good in the current sample as expected (Cronbach's α = 0.70). The HONC is more sensitive to dependence among very light smokers, likely because the score is not weighted heavily by the number of cigarettes smoked per day like other dependence measures . While the HONC was developed for a dichotomous scoring system with any item endorsement indicating loss of autonomy over smoking , we measured it as a continuous marker of the degree of autonomy as has been done previously with non-daily smokers . Event-level assessment At each ad-lib smoking session, participants answered a series of questions about their current emotion, activity, time of day, urge, if they were alone, and if they were currently consuming alcohol. Activities were coded into four categories: leisure (e.g., watching TV, at home, on the computer, and drinking coffee), performative (e.g., completing chores, driving, getting child ready for school), social (e.g., at a party, at a friend's home, at the casino), and interactive (e.g., talking on the phone, arguing with another, business calls, and having a conversation). Emotions were categorized as: positive, negative, neutral, and mixed. The details of these categories, reliability of the coding procedure, and results of the EMA analysis are described in a prior publication . Data analysis Patterns of daily cotinine Data were analyzed using R statistical software (version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05)) and SPSS (version 26). We calculated four descriptive metrics of daily cotinine including the area under the curve (AUC), maximum exposure, minimum exposure, and range of daily values. The AUC is a pharmacokinetic measure that represents total drug exposure over time. AUC for total nicotine exposure during the week was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method. The cotinine range provided a measure of consistency in cotinine values during the week and was calculated as the minimum value subtracted from the maximum value. We divided the sample into tertiles based on the mean cotinine value and plotted each participant's seven daily cotinine values to show graphically the variability in cotinine levels across days and participants (see Fig. ). Associations of cotinine metrics with smoking characteristics, dependence, and activities and emotions Cotinine metrics (AUC, min, max, range) were regressed onto predictor variables including demographics, smoking characteristics, activities, and emotions in separate hierarchical linear regression Covariates included age, sex, race, total family annual income, and marital status. Significance level was set at p-value <.05, and we also applied a Bonferroni correction under the assumption of multiple hypothesis testing where significance level was set at p-value <.003. Results Sample characteristics and tobacco use patterns The sample included 60 non-daily smokers ages 24 to 57 years, who were predominantly white (78%) and non-Hispanic (90%) with an average total family income of $49,414 and more than a high school degree (82%). Approximately half of the total sample was female (52%) and married or living with a partner (45%). Participants reported smoking a mean of 3.2 (SD = 1.8) cigarettes per day and 13.9 (SD = 5.3) days out of the past 30. The mean age of smoking onset was 19.5 (SD = 5.3) years, and the mean duration of nondaily smoking was 8.1 (SD = 7.4) years. Sixty percent of the sample converted from daily smoking to non-daily smoking. The converted non-daily smokers reported switching from daily smoking 6.7 (SD = 7.1) years ago on average, and previously smoking daily for a mean of 8.8 (SD = 7.4) years. Thirty-two participants (53%) endorsed use of menthol cigarettes and 62% reported a lifetime quit attempt. The sample reported smoking an average of 424.3 min after waking (SD = 286.7). The mean HONC dependence score was 4.1 (SD = 2.1). Cotinine metrics Participants were grouped into tertiles based on their mean cotinine values to illustrate the variability of cotinine within and between participants (Fig. ). The sample had a mean daily cotinine value of 119.2 ng/ml (SD = 168.9) with daily values that ranged from nondetectable to 949.6 ng/ml. The mean range was 113.6 (SD = 110.5). The mean AUC was 690.8 (SD = 969.7). The mean nicotine metabolite ratio (3HC/cotinine) was 0.6 (SD = 0.4), and 25% (n = 15) of the sample was categorized as a slow metabolizer with a ratio ≤ 0.3. Figure  displays singleday repeated cotinine values (ng/ml) for the six participants randomly selected to collect five repeated cotinine samples over the course of a single day. Overall, the single-day cotinine values remained stable, especially when mean values were less than 50 ng/ml. Linear hierarchical regression analyses Biological and behavioral smoking characteristics Controlling for demographic variables, shorter time to the first cigarette of the day was associated with significantly higher min, max, and AUC cotinine values (Table ). Preference for menthol cigarettes was associated with significantly higher min, max and AUC  Smoking activities and emotions In total, the sample reported 561 smoking experiences and their associated emotions and activities. On the smoking logs, participants reported an average of 3.8 (SD = 1.8) days of smoking during the collection week and 2.4 (SD = 1.4) cigarettes per smoking day. Three participants reported one instance of using a tobacco product other than a cigarette (i.e., electronic cigarette, snuff, and hookah), one participant reported two instances of cigar use, and one participant reported 19 instances of electronic cigarette use during the collection week. All results remained the same with the latter participant excluded from analysis. reported being alone for 58.9% and using alcohol for 23.5% of all reported experiences of tobacco use. The sample reported engaging in leisure activities during smoking most often (n = 272, 48.5%) followed by performative (n = 161, 28.7%), social (n = 90, 16.0%), and interactive (n = 38, 6.8%) activities. The sample reported experiencing positive emotions during smoking most often (n = 262, 46.7%), followed by negative (n = 179, 31.9%), neutral (n = 91, 16.2%), and mixed (n = 29, 5.2%) emotions. Controlling for demographic variables, more interactive activities and negative emotions were associated with significantly higher min, max, range and AUC cotinine measures (Table ). More positive emotions was significantly associated with a higher range in cotinine values.   Discussion The current study measured nicotine exposure over a 7day collection period among a sample of non-daily smokers. There was considerable variation in cotinine levels across participants and between days with some subjects showing consistent low levels day to day and others showing higher and more variable patterns. Intraday variation was low among the five randomly selected participants who took multiple measurements in a single day. The variability in nicotine exposure in our sample map onto a prior study that conducted a latent class analysis among college students' smoking behavior . This study found three classes of non-daily smokers, including a group who smoked several cigarettes a day on more than half the days in a month, a group who smoked several cigarettes a day primarily in social situations on the weekends, and a group who only occasionally smoked all or part of a cigarette . This study did not measure nicotine exposure, but one could expect that cotinine values for these three groups would look similar to our tertiles, with relatively high, but variable levels in the first group, moderate cotinine levels on few days of the week in the second group, and consistently low levels in the last group. Since nicotine levels correlate with other biomarkers of tobacco-related carcinogens and toxins in daily smokers , non-daily smokers might also experience varying levels of harmful exposure. Some non-daily smokers had high levels of cotinine that were similar to that in daily smokers, while others maintained very low levels throughout the entire week. Those participants who reached high cotinine values on a single day tended to have more variability in their levels throughout the week. A review of the health effects of smokers who smoke just a few cigarettes per day indicated that harm occurs even at low levels of smoking and it can be inferred that nondaily smokers also are at increased risk . Cotinine measures were not associated with loss of autonomy. The HONC scores in the current study were similar to that reported for other non-daily smokers . In addition, nicotine exposure was not higher for converted compared to native daily smokers, which have also been shown to have higher rates of nicotine dependence . All cotinine metrics were associated with time to first cigarette after waking. Shorter time to first cigarette after waking is one of the strongest predictors of higher nicotine dependence severity among daily smokers and has previously been associated with cotinine levels for daily smokers . The findings confirm that non-daily smokers are a heterogenous group with varying levels of nicotine dependence. In our sample, menthol preference predicted higher minimum cotinine values throughout the week. Menthol smoking was also related to higher AUC and maximum cotinine values, although these predictors did not reach statistical significance with Bonferroni correction. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that the use of menthol cigarettes is more common among low income smokers and related to higher levels of dependence . Although there are some reports that menthol is associated with higher nicotine intake in daily smokers, an FDA review did not confirm this finding . Among our sample, menthol smoking was not associated with higher scores on the HONC in a post-hoc analysis (p = 0.30). Our EMA results from the current study and a prior analysis of the sample found that smoking occurred most frequently during positive moods and activities of leisure . Non-daily smokers have stronger stimulus control over their smoking habits than daily smokers . Stimulus control occurs when a smokers' mood, activity, and environmental context become important predictors of smoking behavior, rather than nicotine withdrawal alone . This could explain why our participants with low levels of nicotine exposure still reported perceived symptoms of nicotine dependence (e.g., mean HONC = 4.1). We found that these contextual factors were also important predictors of cotinine in our sample. Smoking during interactive activities and negative emotional states was related to higher min, max, and AUC cotinine values. Positive emotions were linked with more variability in nicotine exposure across days. This could have several explanations. Given the relatively higher levels of dependence among this group, these smokers may experience withdrawal symptoms that induce negative emotions, like irritability and anxiety, which precede and then accompany their next smoking experience. Another potential explanation is that our participants with high cotinine levels may smoke to alleviate perceived stress. Experimentally induced stress has been shown to trigger negative affect and craving among heavy and light smokers and is commonly reported as a barrier to cessation . Future research exploring real-time smoking motives among non-daily smokers may help to elucidate why negative emotions are associated with higher cotinine levels for this group and how we might intervene on these emotions to reduce smoking behavior (see  for review). The current study had several limitations. The sample, comprised primarily of non-Hispanic White smokers, was not nationally representative. For this reason our results may not generalize to Black and Hispanic smokers who are known to have higher rates of non-daily smoking than the general population . In addition, our EMA relied on participants' initiative to record each smoking session and some participants may have underreported the number of cigarettes smoked; however, the sample's self-reported CPD was consistent with prior studies of adults and adolescents . Finally, our study was underpowered to detect small effects and may have missed meaningful associations. For example, lower total family income was associated with higher cotinine exposure, but was not significant. Future research with larger, representative samples will help clarify the relevance of these associations with nicotine exposure for nondaily smokers. Conclusions The current study highlights that nicotine exposure as measured by cotinine among non-daily smokers is as variable as their self-reported patterns of smoking behavior. Nicotine exposure for non-daily smokers varies with behavioral measures of dependence (i.e., time to first cigarette) and contextual factors that have also been found with samples of daily smokers. With a wide range in nicotine exposure and consistently low nicotine dependence and cessation rates, some non-daily smokers may not fit with the long-held theory that nicotine is the primary factor that sustains smoking addiction . Instead, these findings point to the need for more detailed assessments of smoking behavior to guide the development of effective cessation interventions for this variable group of smokers. Future research could inform our limited understanding of the biobehavioral mechanisms that contribute to individual differences in nicotine exposure among non-daily smokers and inform the development of personalized interventions that help non-daily smokers manage internal and external cues for smoking.

7,7,Daily variation in sleep characteristics in individuals with and without post traumatic stress disorder,"Background: Sleep disturbances are common in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, little is known about how daily variation in sleep characteristics is related to PTSD. This study examined the nightto-night and weekday versus weekend variation in sleep duration, sleep quality, trouble falling asleep, and difficulty staying asleep in individuals with and without PTSD.Methods: Participants (N = 157; 80 with PTSD, 77 without PTSD) completed daily self-reports of their nighttime sleep characteristics for 15 consecutive days. Linear mixed models were used to examine the associations between the 7 days of the week and weekday versus weekend variation in sleep characteristics and PTSD.Results: Individuals with PTSD reported shorter sleep duration, lower sleep quality, more trouble falling asleep, and more difficulty staying asleep than individuals without PTSD. The pattern of change across the week and between weekdays and weekends was different between those with and without PTSD for sleep quality and trouble falling asleep. Among those with PTSD, sleep duration, sleep quality, and trouble falling asleep differed across the 7 days of the week and showed differences between weekdays and weekends. For those without PTSD, only sleep duration differed across the 7 days of the week and showed differences between weekdays and weekends. Neither group showed 7 days of the week nor weekday versus weekend differences in difficulty staying asleep. Conclusions: On average those with PTSD had shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality, and greater trouble falling and staying asleep. In particular, the day of week variation in sleep quality and trouble falling asleep specifically distinguishes those with PTSD from those without PTSD. Our findings suggest that clinical care might be improved by assessments of sleep patterns and disturbances across at least a week, including weekdays and weekends. Future studies should explore the mechanisms related to the patterns of sleep disturbance among those with PTSD.","[""Sleep"", ""Symptom assessment"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Military personnel""]",10.1186/s12888-021-03282-3,"Background Sleep disturbances are common in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) . Up to 92% of those with PTSD have reported at least one sleep disturbance in both general population and military samples . Individuals with PTSD are more likely to have a shorter sleep duration  and report poor sleep quality  compared to those without PTSD. Having trouble falling asleep and difficulty staying asleep (the predominant symptoms of insomnia) are part of the diagnosis of PTSD  and are among the most frequently reported symptoms of post traumatic stress . Examining the day of week (DOW) patterns in sleep disturbances in those with and without PTSD may aid in understanding the fundamental mechanisms and possible treatments for PTSD. Several studies have examined the relationship between sleep disturbances and next day PTSD symptoms in populations with PTSD . Sleep duration, sleep quality, trouble falling asleep, and difficulty staying asleep were generally associated with next day PTSD symptoms . These studies provide some evidence that variation in sleep disturbances across time was high among individuals with PTSD. For instance, 58 and 63% of the variance in sleep duration and sleep quality, respectively, were due to within-person change . To our knowledge, no studies have specifically looked at DOW variation in sleep characteristics among individuals with PTSD. Daily assessment of sleep across time (e.g., ""How many hours of sleep did you get last night?"") as opposed to retrospective mean assessment of sleep across time (e.g., ""During the past month, how many hours of sleep did you get at night?""), can provide information about how sleep changes over time. Methods of repeated experience sampling including ecological momentary assessments (EMA) and daily sleep diaries are well-suited to assessing symptom change over time . Examination of DOW variation in sleep and sleep disturbances is likely to better capture the impact of situational factors such as work schedules, threat cues, and lifestyle factors. Differences in sleep have, in general, been examined in two ways, by looking at mean change over time and intraindividual variability. In this study, we focus on change over time of sleep characteristics and how the pattern of variation may distinguish PTSD from non-PTSD. Specifically, we examined variation in sleep disturbances across the 7 days of the week and in weekdays versus weekends in individuals with and without PTSD. Understanding the pattern of sleep characteristics across the week may aid in distinguishing diagnoses, improve our understanding of the mechanisms of disorder, inform development of treatment interventions, and suggest possible causes of variation such as weekday versus weekend lifestyle factors (e.g., work, leisure activities, social support). Therefore, in this paper we examined the DOW variation of sleep duration, sleep quality, trouble falling asleep, and difficulty staying asleep in individuals with and without PTSD. Sleep characteristics were assessed by daily self-report for 15 consecutive days. Linear mixed models were used to examine each of the four sleep characteristics across the 7 days of the week and for weekdays versus weekends. We anticipated that sleep characteristics would be worse (shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality, more trouble falling and staying asleep) among those with PTSD compared to those without PTSD, but had no expectations about the relationship between daily or weekday versus weekend variation in sleep characteristics and PTSD. Methods Participants Participants were N = 183 current and former U.S. Service members. A total of n = 157 were included in data analyses, n = 14 did not return the daily assessments, n = 10 did not provide three or more daily assessments of sleep, n = 1 did not complete the assessment of probable PTSD in the pre-questionnaire, and n = 1 was removed as an outlier. This study was part of a larger data collection project examining post traumatic stress in U.S. military personnel. Methods common to the larger project have been reported in prior publications  and are included in Supplement 1. The research was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland. Informed consent was obtained after the procedures were explained and participation was voluntary. Procedure and measures Recruitment and enrollment screening Participants were recruited from a military treatment facility and completed a 26-item screening questionnaire (see Supplement 1). Assessment of PTSD Once enrolled, we determined probable PTSD. Participants completed a 79-item assessment of exposure to traumatic events (see Supplement 1). All participants had at least one qualifying traumatic exposure. Participants also completed the 20-item PTSD Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition (PCL-5; DSM-5) . The PCL-5 assessed DSM-5 PTSD clusters B (intrusion: items 1-5), C (avoidance: items 6-7), D (negative cognitions/ mood: items , and E (hyperarousal: items . Two of the 20 items are related to sleep disturbance (""Repeated, disturbing dreams of the stressful experience"" and ""Trouble falling or staying asleep""). Each item had four response choices, 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Extremely), and the symptom severity score range was 0-80. The PCL-5 has demonstrated good internal consistency (α = .96), test-retest reliability (r = .84), and convergent and discriminant validity in Service member populations . A diagnosis of probable PTSD was made by considering each item rated 2 (Moderately) or higher as an endorsed symptom, then following the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria requiring one or more cluster A traumatic exposures, one or more items from clusters B and C, two or more items from clusters D and E, and a symptom severity score of 38 or higher . Of the N = 157 participants, n = 80 met criteria for probable PTSD (hereafter referred to as those with PTSD) and n = 77 did not meet criteria for PTSD. Daily assessments For the following 15 days, participants completed four assessments per day using an EMA methodology, including an assessment of sleep characteristics on the first assessment of each day (see Supplement 1). The first 39 consecutive subjects (24.8%) completed daily assessments on paper questionnaires (Phase 1) and the next 118 subjects (75.2%) completed the same assessments on an Apple Inc. iPad 2 with a software application designed specifically for use in this study (Phase 2). The phase of the study was controlled for all analyses and was not a significant covariate. In total, N = 1994 sleep assessments were collected. Of those, n = 47 (2.4%) were dropped from data analysis because they were completed too early (n = 15), too late (n = 18), were missing the completion date or time (n = 13), or due to an irreconcilable error in electronic data (n = 1). Of the N = 1947 assessments included in the analyses, n = 1482 (76.1%) were completed within 0-2 h, n = 331 (17.0%) within 2-4 h, and n = 134 (6.9%) within 4-6 h of the 6-h assessment completion window. The overall adherence rate (i.e., percentage completed out of 2355 possible sleep assessments) was 82.7% in the present sample. Sleep characteristics Sleep duration was assessed with one item adapted from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) , ""How many hours of actual sleep did you get last night? (This may be different than the number of hours you spent in bed)."" Participants wrote in the number of hours of sleep and, if necessary, responses were rounded to the nearest quarter hour (see Supplement 1 for details of the sleep measures). Sleep quality was assessed with one item adapted from the PSQI, ""How would you rate your sleep quality overall last night?"" Response choices ranged from 0 (Very bad) to 3 (Very good), with high scores reflecting better sleep quality. Trouble falling asleep was assessed with three items and difficulty staying asleep was assessed with six items, and these nine items were adapted from the PCL-5 , PSQI , SLEEP-50  or developed for use in this study by the authors (RJU & CSF). Item instructions were ""Below is a list of sleep problems. Please fill in the bubble according to what you experienced last night."" Response choices were 0 (No) and 1 (Yes). Cronbach's alpha internal reliability, assessed at the person level, was acceptable or good for trouble falling asleep (α = 0.63) and difficulty staying asleep (α = 0.72). The mean of the items within the trouble falling asleep dimension and the difficulty staying asleep dimension was used in the analyses, indicating the percent of the sleep problem that the participant experienced during the previous night (range = 0-1), with high score reflecting more trouble falling asleep or more difficulty staying asleep. DOW and weekday/weekend variables A 7-day and a dichotomous weekday (Monday through Friday)/weekend (Saturday and Sunday) variable were created to test if the four sleep characteristics differed by the day of the week. The previous night's sleep characteristics were reported on the first assessment of the following day (e.g., Saturday and Sunday's report captured the sleep characteristics of Friday and Saturday night's sleep). Data analyses DOW variation in sleep characteristics was assessed using linear mixed models with daily assessments (Level-1) nested within subjects (Level-2). The first-order autoregression assumption (AR ) was compared to compound symmetry and was selected for within-subject residuals for all analyses (see Supplement 2 for further details). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was provided to identify the proportion of variance due to Level 1 and Level 2 in the analysis (see Supplement 2). We first examined whether each sleep characteristic varied across the 7 days of the week or between weekdays versus weekends in the total sample and in individuals with and without PTSD. The total group analyses allowed us to examine sleep characteristic differences by PTSD group controlling for DOW and demographic covariates. The stratified analyses explored the DOW variation in individuals with PTSD, our group of primary interest, and provided a comparison to those without PTSD. We then examined whether participants with and without PTSD differed in each sleep characteristic across the 7 days of the week or between weekdays versus weekends by testing the interaction of PTSD group and DOW. Due to the low statistical power to detect crosslevel interaction effects in mixed models , we were aware that the interaction analysis was informative but limited. In the 7 DOW analyses the Tukey-Kramer method was used to adjust for multiple pairwise comparisons. Sex, age, race, education, and phase of the study (paper versus electronic) were included as covariates. Mixed model analyses were conducted in PC SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). To determine the specific statistical power of our sample to detect the DOW difference as a within-subject predictor and PTSD group difference as a betweensubject predictor, a series of Monte Carlo simulation post-hoc power analyses were conducted . Results showed a high statistical power to detect a significant within-subject predictor, but a relatively low power for a between-subject predictor. For example, for sleep duration, at a power of 80% with 77 individuals (the smaller group size in the current study) and a mean of 12 observations per individual, we are able to detect a weekday versus weekend difference of .23 standard deviations, which can be considered a small effect size. A significant between-subject predictor (e.g., PTSD group) in an analysis of 157 individuals would require an effect size of .43 standard deviations, which can be considered a medium effect size. Post-hoc power analyses were conducted in Mplus version 7.11 . Results Sample demographics and descriptive statistics Demographics and descriptive statistics are shown in Table . Mean age of participants in the analytic sample (N = 157) was 41.50 (range 19-76). The majority (59.2%, n = 93) were male, White (65.0%, n = 102), and 55.4% (n = 87) had a bachelor's degree education or higher. The majority (65.6%, n = 103) were married with 76.4% (n = 81) currently living with their spouse. In total, 80 (51.0%) had PTSD and 77 (49.0%) did not have PTSD. There were no differences between those with PTSD and those without PTSD on demographic characteristics, except that individuals with PTSD were younger than those without PTSD (38.84 vs. 44.34, t = 2.54, p = .012).  Comparing individuals with and without PTSD by Intraclass correlation coefficients The  Sleep duration In individuals with and without PTSD, each of the five weekdays (Monday to Friday) had shorter sleep duration  , Table , and Fig. ). Among individuals without PTSD, the estimated means of sleep duration were 5.61 for weekdays and 6.27 for weekends, β = − 0.66 [− 0.87, − 0.44], p < .001. Sleep quality In individuals without PTSD, there was no difference in sleep quality across the 7 days or between weekdays and weekends. In individuals with PTSD, sleep quality on Tuesday and Thursday was worse than Saturday, which was set as the reference (see Fig.  and Supplement 3). Pairwise comparisons with Tukey-Kramer adjustment showed that Saturday was different from Thursday, and Sunday was different from Tuesday and Thursday. By weekday versus weekend, the Least-squares estimated means of sleep quality in individuals with PTSD were 1.34 for weekdays and 1.49 for weekends, β = − 0.15 [− 0.25, − 0.04], p = .007 (see Table , Fig. , and Supplement 4a). Trouble falling asleep In individuals without PTSD, there was no difference in trouble falling asleep across the 7 days or between weekdays and weekends. In individuals with PTSD, more trouble falling asleep was reported on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday than Saturday, the reference (see Fig.  and Supplement 3). Pairwise comparisons with Tukey-Kramer adjustment showed that Sunday was different from Tuesday and Thursday. By weekday versus weekend, the Least-squares estimated means of trouble falling asleep in individuals with PTSD were 0.55 for weekdays and 0.48 for weekends, β = 0.07 [0.04, 0.11], p < .001 (see Table , Fig. , and Supplement 4b). Difficulty staying asleep In individuals with and without PTSD, there was no difference in difficulty staying asleep across the 7 days or between weekdays and weekends (see Table , Fig. , and Supplement 4c). Differences between individuals with and without PTSD There were significant differences by PTSD group in all four sleep characteristics after controlling for weekday versus weekend (similar results were found for the 7-day DOW) and demographic covariates (see Table ).  Interaction of PTSD group and DOW The interaction of PTSD group and DOW examined whether participants with and without PTSD statistically differed in each sleep characteristic across the 7 days or between weekdays versus weekends. The only significant   Discussion This study examined sleep characteristics (sleep duration, sleep quality, trouble falling asleep, and difficulty staying asleep) and their variation across the 7 days of the week and specifically for weekdays versus weekends in individuals with and without PTSD. Similar to others , we found that on average those with PTSD had shorter sleep duration, poorer quality of sleep, and greater trouble falling and staying asleep. Although only two of these characteristics (i.e., trouble falling and staying asleep) are noted in the DSM-5 diagnosis of PTSD, in fact all four sleep characteristics differ between those with PTSD and those without PTSD. Importantly, the pattern of change across the 7 days of the week and the change between weekdays and weekends are different for those with PTSD compared to those without PTSD for sleep quality and trouble falling asleep. Among those with PTSD, sleep duration, sleep quality, and trouble falling asleep differed across the 7 days of the week and showed differences between weekdays and weekends. In contrast, for those without PTSD, only sleep duration differed across the 7 days of the week and showed differences between weekdays and weekends. For difficulty staying asleep, neither group differed across the 7 days of the week nor weekdays versus weekends. Sleep duration varied across the 7 days of the week and specifically for weekdays versus weekends for both those with and without PTSD, which is consistent with previous studies . For healthy adults, the average sleep duration is 7-8 h per night and duration is approximately 30 min longer on weekends compared to weekdays . In our study, mean sleep duration was 5.34 h among those with PTSD and 5.90 h among those without PTSD, and both groups slept longer on weekends (approximately 32 min longer for those with PTSD and 40 min longer for those without PTSD). However, the average sleep duration of those with PTSD, even with more sleep on weekends, was never as high as the average weekday sleep duration of those without PTSD. Other studies have found that days in which sleep duration is much shorter or longer that an individual's average are associated with worse cognitive functioning . Habitual short sleep duration (e.g., < 5 h per night) and long sleep duration (e.g., > 9 h per night) are associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality . Others have found that variation in the pattern between weekdays and weekends may also be associated with depressive symptoms , although not increased mortality . Sleep quality varied across the 7 days of the week and was better on weekends than weekdays, but only among those with PTSD. Sleep quality is closely related to the other sleep characteristics . The specific weekday versus weekend difference among those with PTSD may therefore suggest that PTSD-related stressors (such as threat cues) may be more common during weekdays or, alternatively, protective factors such as social support may be more present on weekends. Further study of sleep quality and its relationship to threat cues and social support is needed to understand the differences in sleep quality among those with and without PTSD. Trouble falling asleep, like sleep quality, varied across the 7 days of the week and differed between weekdays and weekends, but only for those with PTSD. Falling asleep has been closely studied to identify behavioral and pharmacologic interventions to decrease sleep latency . However, little is known about the neurobiology of falling asleep. PTSD is associated with being hyperalert to cues of threat which may also interfere with falling asleep. Further study of the neurobiological and behavioral aspects of trouble falling asleep among those with PTSD may aid in identifying interventions for this sleep characteristic and improve our understanding of the neurobiology of PTSD. It is valuable to note, as above, that sleep quality and trouble falling asleep showed weekday-weekend variation only among those with PTSD. These sleep characteristics may therefore offer unique opportunities to understand PTSD as well as important targets for intervention. Weekday-weekend variation in sleep disturbances may be related to a number of factors expected to differ between those with and without PTSD including occupational stress, daily activities, social interactions, substance use, as well as fundamental neurobiological differences. Difficulty staying asleep, in contrast to the other three sleep characteristics, did not show variation across the 7 days of the week nor weekdays versus weekends in either group. However, those with PTSD reported significantly more frequent difficulty staying asleep (32% of nights versus 16% of nights among those without PTSD). Prior research has shown that difficulty staying asleep was the strongest predictor of next day's post traumatic stress symptoms . These data therefore suggest that better understanding the greater frequency of difficulty staying asleep, rather than its temporal pattern may aid in understanding its relationship to next day's post traumatic stress symptoms. Our findings suggest that clinical care might be improved by assessments of sleep patterns and disturbances across at least a week, including weekdays and weekends. This is consistent with other studies that found one or two nights of sleep measurement may not accurately represent an individual's habitual sleep pattern . Wide fluctuations in sleep characteristics among those with PTSD comprise a major challenge for clinicians, whose ministrations may be difficult to assess in light of such variations . Sleep diaries can be an important addition to sleep assessments as they provide night-to-night information about sleep characteristics, promote discussions about sleep-related behavior, and may aid in identifying temporal relationships between sleep disturbances and daily events, which may be critical for interventions for sleep and PTSD. We know little about the importance of timing of interventions for maximum efficacy of behavioral or pharmacologic interventions. For instance, a medication to reduce trouble falling asleep may appear more or less effective depending on the day of the week that treatment is initiated. The individual's sleep duration pattern may inform the choice of sleep medication and use of medication may not be necessary on nights when there is typically little trouble falling asleep. The current study has several limitations. The measures are self-report and therefore subject to recall errors. This limitation is partially mitigated by collection of the daily report of sleep characteristics within hours of awakening and use of well-validated self-assessment measures. Sleep quality was measured with one item and results may have been different with a more extensive measure of sleep quality. The prevalence of sleep problems may be biased due to missing data. In addition, our sample consisted of current and former Service members and our findings may not generalize to civilians. Lastly, the statistical power to detect a between-person predictor and especially a significant interaction involving between-group predictors is limited. Thus, the results of interaction analyses are considered exploratory and only informative. These results highlight the differences in sleep characteristics and their variation during the week between those with PTSD and without PTSD. Importantly, the pattern of sleep quality and trouble falling asleep specifically distinguishes those with PTSD from those without PTSD. Future studies should explore the mechanisms related to the patterns of sleep disturbance among those with PTSD and the factors associated with the substantial proportion of within-person variance in sleep disturbances. Further understanding of the neurobiology of sleep characteristics may aid in identifying the disruptions associated with PTSD and may help to identify potential targets for behavioral and pharmacologic interventions. Conclusions On average those with PTSD had shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality, and greater trouble falling and staying asleep. Importantly, the pattern of change across the 7 days of the week and between weekdays and weekends are different for those with PTSD compared to those without PTSD for sleep quality and trouble falling asleep. Our findings suggest that clinical care might be improved by assessments of sleep patterns and disturbances across at least a week, including weekdays and weekends. Future studies should explore the mechanisms related to the patterns of sleep disturbance among those with PTSD. "
8,8,Do daily mood fluctuations activate ruminative thoughts as a mental habit? Results from an ecological momentary assessment study,"It has been suggested that mental habits may underpin a heightened disposition to engage in rumination in response to negative mood. The aim of the current study was to assess the role of habit in the dynamic interplay between affect and ruminative thinking in the flow of daily life experiences. Using mobile ecological momentary assessment, 97 participants recorded affect and rumination ten times daily over six days, after completing measures of trait ruminative brooding and habitual characteristics of negative thinking (e.g. automaticity, lack of conscious awareness, intent and control). Momentary fluctuations in negative (increased) and positive (decreased) affect was prospectively associated with greater rumination-levels at the next sampling occasion. The degree to which affect triggered a subsequent ruminative response was moderated by habitual characteristics of negative thinking in a theoretically consistent way. Stronger temporal pairing of negative affect and rumination was also associated with greater emotional inertia but less carry-over of rumination from one moment to the next. Depression vulnerability may be in the form of rumination being habitually triggered in response to momentary fluctuations in affect, with deleterious effect on mood. The findings may have clinical implications, as targeting the habitual nature of rumination might help reduce depression vulnerability.","[""Depression"", ""Rumination"", ""Habit"", ""Ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1016/j.brat.2021.103832,"Introduction Ruminative thinking is critical in the onset and maintenance of major depressive disorder  and has been identified as a transdiagnostic vulnerability factor for a number of aversive outcomes (e.g. anxiety, eating disorder, alcohol misuse; . Rumination is a negative thinking style that involves repetitively and passively dwelling on the causes, meanings, and consequences of one's feelings and distress . Considerable evidence suggests that rumination exacerbates negative affect and cognition, impairs problem solving, and leads to more persistent periods of dysphoric mood (Nolen-Hoeksema, . The Response Styles Theory defines rumination as an enduring, stable, and habitual-like tendency  suggesting that mental habits may underpin a heightened disposition to engage in rumination. This is in line with descriptions of rumination as a habit in the depression literature (see e.g.  and recent theoretical conceptualizations of depression vulnerability (e.g. . Habits are formed by learned associations between behavioural responses and their performance contexts. Once formed, context cues become automatic triggers for the behaviour, such that it is controlled solely by the presence of the context cue, rather than individual's goals or motivations . Habits are characterized by a lack of awareness and conscious intent, are mentally efficient, and can be difficult to control .  proposed a habit-goal  The study was funded by research grants from the Icelandic Centre for Research  and the Eimskip Fund of The University of Iceland. framework wherein rumination is seen as a mental habit that is initiated without conscious awareness or intent in response to negative mood. Transient periods of rumination are thought to arise when people try to cope with discrepancies between desired states and their present reality. This process is considered adaptive when ruminating about the discrepancy helps reach important goals, however, when goals are repeatedly not reached, rumination persists and mood deteriorates . When people consistently rely on passive, negative and abstract ruminative thoughts to cope with such discrepancies, negative affect and ruminative thinking are paired over time, turning rumination into a habit that is triggered by context (i.e., negative affect) rather than goals or intentions. Maladaptive rumination is therefore expected to be associated with heightened habitual characteristics (i.e., be more repetitive and automatic) compared to other less maladaptive forms of rumination. Nonetheless, the notion of rumination as a mental habit has rarely been directly tested.  used the Habit Index of Negative Thinking (HINT) -a self-report measure of habitual characteristics of negative thoughts (i.e., repetition, lack of conscious awareness and deliberate intent, mental efficiency, lack of control and self-descriptiveness) -and found that ruminative thoughts were strongly correlated with heightened habitual characteristics. Consistent with this,  found that ruminative brooding, a maladaptive form of rumination, was associated with heightened habitual characteristics whereas ruminative pondering, a more adaptive form of rumination, was not. Although promising, these findings are limited in a number of ways. Because rumination is measured at a single time point and averaged across time, they may not generalize to momentary fluctuations in rumination and affect. Participants also report on their rumination by thinking back to a time when they felt sad and recall their experiences, increasing the probability of retrospective bias. In a similar vein, previous findings do not allow for an inference about the temporal relationship between affect and rumination, rendering causal inference impossible. One way to address these shortcomings is to use more ecologically valid assessment procedures, such as Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), to capture fluctuations in thinking and affect in the flow of daily life experiences (e.g. . Studies using EMA have revealed a reciprocal relationship between rumination and affect, with rumination predicting negative affect at a subsequent measurement occasion, and negative affect predicting subsequent rumination to the same effect . They also show that a strong temporal relationship between negative affect and subsequent rumination is associated with heightened symptoms of depression and greater emotional inertia , that is the increased carry over of negative emotions from one moment to the next . We are not aware of any EMA studies that directly test the assumption that fluctuations in negative affect trigger rumination across time as a function of habit. Furthermore, the relationship of such habitual rumination with emotional inertia remains unclear. Given that habits might explain persistent patterns of rumination , which in turn have been associated with greater emotional inertia , it may be that habitually ruminating in response to negative affect contributes to more persistent negative mood states (i.e., greater inertia). Consistent with this,  found that a strong temporal pairing of affect-rumination tended to co-occur with emotional inertia, such that individuals with heightened symptoms of depression tended to be characterized by both high levels of emotional inertia and a strong temporal pairing of affect-rumination. Finally, to our knowledge no study has assessed how habitual rumination relates to everyday levels of positive affect, which may be an important resilience factor that reduces momentary rumination . Although failed resolution of goals has usually been associated with increases in negative affect, it is equally possible that it results in detrimental changes in the momentary experiences of positive affect, and that decreased levels of positive affect and ruminative thinking may be paired over time. In line with this, depression has not only been associated with greater levels of momentary negative affect but also decreased levels of everyday positive affect . However, the relevance of positive affect to the rumination process is relatively understudied and therefore not well understood, and the possible link between changes in positive affect and subsequent rumination therefore exploratory in nature. The present study The aim of the current study was to assess if the habitual characteristics of negative thoughts are related to the dynamic interplay between negative affect and ruminative thinking in the flow of daily life experiences. In line with vulnerability-stress models of depression  and recent emphases on dimensional approaches to the study of mechanisms contributing to psychopathology , the study was conducted in a non-selected sample with a wide range of depressive symptoms. We utilized EMA wherein participants provide everyday 'in the moment' data about their immediate experiences when prompted by an alarm signal. Momentary affect and rumination were assessed multiple times during the day over a 6-day period, allowing for the assessment of their temporal relationships. As mentioned earlier, advantages of EMA are that it provides findings with high ecological validity  and virtually eliminates retrospective bias . Furthermore, imperative to the measurement of habits, EMA can evaluate fluctuations in affect and rumination over short temporal intervals, allowing researchers to investigate contingencies of which people may be unaware . We tested two hypotheses derived from the habit-goal framework of depressive rumination ) and prior findings . First, we expected increased negative affect to prospectively predict greater rumination-levels at the next sampling occasion. Secondly, because the habit-goal framework predicts that rumination can develop into a mood-linked habit, measures of habit should be specifically associated with the degree to which affect triggers rumination across time rather than just being associated with average levels of momentary rumination. We therefore expected the interplay between negative affect and rumination to be moderated by habit, with increased habitual characteristics of negative thinking predicting greater rumination in response to fluctuations in negative affect. To our knowledge this is the first direct empirical test of the relationship between the habitual characteristics of thought and the dynamic interplay between affect and rumination. We also explored if the same pattern of findings would be apparent when looking at the deterioration of positive affect as a possible trigger for momentary rumination. Finally, given that the temporal pairing of negative affect and rumination has been associated with emotional inertia  we also explored if habitual characteristic are associated with heightened emotional inertia during the EMA assessment. Method Participants One hundred and fifteen students of various disciplines at the University of Iceland were recruited via an introductory e-mail sent out to all registered students. We requested volunteers for a study on depression vulnerability although we made it clear that participants did not have to be depressed to take part. As intended, we obtained a sample with a wide range of depressive symptoms as measured with the Beck Depression Inventory -II (range = 0-50, M = 14.9, SD = 10.1). Inclusion criteria were an age between 18 and 65 years and being fluent in Icelandic. Due to technical difficulties seven participants were unable to participate and three dropped out of the study due to time limitations and had no valid responses. Of the participants, 106 completed the EMA measurements. Eight were subsequently excluded due to inadequate EMA compliance (fewer than 10 completed alerts), resulting in a final sample of 97 participants (24 males, 73 females; mean age 23.3 years; SD = 2.81). Participants were rewarded with the equivalent of €30 for their participation. Measures 2.2.1. Trait-level questionnaires 2.2.1.1. The ruminative responses scale . The RRS is a self-report measure of ruminative disposition which contains 22 items that assess a person's tendency to think about the symptoms, causes, and consequences of their depressed mood. The current study utilized the 5-item brooding subscale (RRS-B), which measures more passive, analytical and repetitive forms of thinking, and is thought to represent the maladaptive component of rumination . The Icelandic version of the RRS has shown good psychometric properties . In the current study RRS-B had an α = 0.91. Habit Index of Negative Thinking (HINT) . The habitual quality of negative thinking was measured with the HINT , a 12 item self-report scale that measures the degree to which negative thoughts occur frequently, are initiated without awareness, are unintended, are difficult to control, and are self-descriptive. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale in response to the general prompt; ""Thinking negatively about myself is something…"". and included items such as ""I do unintentionally"" and ""I start doing before I realize I'm doing it"". The HINT thus taps the process aspectsthe repetitive and automatic nature of the thoughtswhich are considered as key elements of mental habits, and which can be distinguished from the content and valence of the thoughts themselves . Evidence of discriminant validity between habitual negative thinking and rumination come from a series of studies by  that found HINT to uniquely contribute to feelings of low self-worth over and above rumination, finding them to be related but empirically distinct. Furthermore, a commonality analyses by  showed that although HINT shared variance with both rumination and worry in predicting symptoms of depression, HINT also accounted for considerable unique variance not attributable to either rumination or worry. The Icelandic version of the HINT has high internal consistency and good discriminant validity . In the current study HINT had an α = 0.93. . The BDI-II is a 21 item self-report questionnaire that measures the severity of depression symptoms during the past two weeks. The Icelandic versions of the BDI-II  has shown good psychometric properties. The BDI-II had an α = 0.91 in the current study. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; EMA measures 2.2.2.1. Negative and positive affect (NA/PA ). Participants rated their current mood at each assessment during the EMA period. The choice of items was based on the widely used Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS;  and previous EMA studies (revealing items with high loadings on NA and PA latent factors; e.g., Wichers, Lothmann, Simons, Nicolson, & Peeters, 2012). NA consisted of the following items: 1) I feel sad right now, 2) I feel irritable right now, and 3) I feel guilty right now. PA consisted of the items: 1) I feel happy or cheerful right now, 2) I feel enthusiastic right now, and 3) I feel satisfied right now. Participants responded using a five-point Likert scale from 1 (Not at all) to 5 (Very much). NA had an α = 0.71 and was strongly correlated with BDI-II (r = 0.54; see Table ) whereas PA had an α = 0.81 and was negatively correlated with BDI-II (r = − 0.43; see Table ). 1 Momentary Ruminative Self-Focus Inventory -abbreviated (MRSI-A). The MSRI is a 6-item questionnaire that measures state-level fluctuations in ruminative self-focus ). An abbreviated form  was chosen for use during the EMA period which contained three items: 1) Right now, I am thinking about how happy or sad I feel, 2) Right now, I wonder why I react the way I do, and 3) Right now, I am thinking about the possible meaning of the way I feel. Participants indicated their degree of rumination at the time of the alert using a 7-point Likert scale, from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 7 (Strongly agree). Both forms of the MRSI have shown excellent internal consistency and are correlated with alternative measures of rumination . In the present study, the MSRI-A had an α = 0.90 and was moderately correlated with RRS-B (r = 0.28; see Table ). 1 Procedure During an in-laboratory assessment session, participants completed the trait-level measures (BDI-II, RRS, HINT), were briefed one-on-one on the EMA procedure, and reviewed a sample EMA alert with the researcher to ensure proper understanding of the smartphone app and the sampling procedure. Beginning the following day after the in-lab assessment, participants were prompted by the smartphone app to answer 10 alerts per day for six consecutive days during a 12-h period (between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m.). Alerts were programmed according to a stratified semi-random interval scheme. Each day was divided into ten 72 min intervals, with a signal occurring randomly within each interval, with an average of 92 min between alerts. Each time, participants gave their momentary rating of rumination and affect (PA, NA, MRSI-A). Participants were instructed to answer given how they felt and thought ""in the moment"" and to complete the measures immediately upon receiving an alert. After receiving an alert, participants had 15 min to respond before it expired. Alerts were presented and responses collected using The Experience Sampler App  an open-source smartphone app intended for ecological momentary assessment research (www.experiencesampler.com). Upon completing the EMA period, participants returned to the laboratory where they were debriefed and received compensation. This study is part of a larger multi-study research project that also included measures of emotion regulation and depression vulnerability that are reported elsewhere (e.g. . Statistical analyses Descriptive statistics were computed using R (R Core Team, 2018). Participants with fewer than 10 out of 60 completed alerts were excluded from the analyses. 2 Given the nested structure of the data (repeated assessments within individuals) we utilized Dynamic Structural Equation Modelling (DSEM) in Mplus 8.1, a multilevel approach to  Correlations are based on within-person averages of NA, PA and MSRI-A.  Previous research has shown that measures with less than 30% completed alerts may be less reliable . Our results remained virtually unchanged when using a more conservative criteria of at least 20 out of 60 valid alerts. We therefore present results based on a more inclusive sample in our analyses. analysing EMA data . The models were run using Bayesian estimation with uninformative priors. We used 50.000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo iterations, of which every 10th was recorded for estimation purposes. A Bayesian approach is used in DSEM because it allows for simultaneous estimation of multiple dependent variables and, thus, is suited for examining cross-lagged models and bidirectional effects. Furthermore, it allows for the modelling of time-series data when the interval between measurements are of unequal distance . Another strength of DSEM is that it eliminates biases known to be associated with the use of lagged variables as predictors of autoregressive and other time-varying effects (i.e., Nickell's and Lüdtke's bias; . In order to test our hypotheses, two successive multilevel models were computed, with either NA or PA as a measure of momentary affect. A visual representation of the models is presented in Fig. . In both models, rumination (MRSI-A) and affect (NA/PA) at any given time-point (t) were predicted by rumination and affect at the previous time-point (t-1). We were interested in the effect of the variables on themselves (autoregressive paths) and on each other (crosslagged paths). These associations were allowed to differ between individuals (i.e., random means and slopes). We tested whether habitual characteristics (HINT) predicted the strength of the person-specific autoregressive and cross-lagged relationships between rumination and affect. We follow Hamaker (2017), Hamaker, Asparouhov, & Muthén (2017),  in presenting our models. The models decompose affect and rumination into latent within-and between-person components. The within-person components describe affect and rumination of individual i at time t: Affect it = μ Affect, i + ϕ 1i Affect (w) it− 1 + ϕ 3i Rumination (w) it− 1 + ζ 1it Rumination it = μ Rumination, i + ϕ 2i Rumination (w) it− 1 + ϕ 4i Affect (w) it− 1 + ζ 2it where μ Affect, i and μ Rumination, i are the time-invariant (between-person) means of affect and rumination for individual i. The autoregressive parameters ϕ 1i and ϕ 2i represent the effect of the variables at t-1 on themselves at time t. The cross lagged parameters ϕ 3i and ϕ 4i are the effects of the variables at t-1 on each other at time t. The parameters ζ 1it and ζ 2it represent the residual variation at time-point t not explained by rumination and affect at the previous time-point t-1. Both the means μ i and the lagged parameters ϕ i are allowed to vary across individuals (hence the subscript i). We estimate the effect on HINT on these random effects on the between-level: μ Affect, i = γ 00 + γ 01 HINT i + u 0i μ Rumination, i = γ 10 + γ 11 HINT i + u 1i ϕ 1i = γ 20 + γ 21 HINT i + u 2i ϕ 2i = γ 30 + γ 31 HINT i + u 3i ϕ 3i = γ 40 + γ 41 HINT i + u 4i ϕ 4i = γ 50 + γ 51 HINT i + u 5i where γ 00-50 is the fixed or group average of the parameters and u i is the individual deviations from these effects. On the between level, HINT, denoted as γHINT, is included as a predictor of the person-specific means and person-specific autoregressive and cross-lagged associations. All the parameters were allowed to covary with each other. We report withinperson standardized coefficients. In our models, statistical significance is based on the credible interval not containing zero (the default in DSEM). The corresponding Mplus code is included in the supplementary materials (Supplementary 1). Results Preliminary analyses Participants completed a total of 2710 EMA alerts. Mean number of completed alerts was 33.1 (SD 11.4; range 10-53). See Table  for descriptive statistics. HINT was positively correlated with ruminative brooding (RRS), indicating that greater habitual characteristics are associated with a heightened ruminative disposition. On the other hand, HINT, was not correlated with average levels of momentary rumination. As we shall see, this is an example of how time-invariant means are illsuited at capturing meaningful within-person variation across time. Affect and rumination across time The standardized effects and variances are presented in Table  and their corresponding paths are visualized in Fig.  3 . Across both models, the autoregressive values (the effect of the variables on themselves) for NA (ϕNA→NA; B = 0.350) and PA (ϕPA→PA; B = 0.427) were significant, indicating carry-over (inertia) of both affective states from one moment to the next. The autoregressive effect for rumination (MRSI-A) was also significant for both models (ϕRum→Rum; Bs = 0.257 and 0.299) indicating that once initiated, rumination tended to persist. The cross-lagged values (the effect of the variables on each other over time) revealed paths from affect to rumination, in both models, when controlling for initial levels of rumination (Table ). The results show that individuals with heightened NA at one moment engaged in more rumination on the next measurement occasion (ϕNA→Rum; B = 0.118), and similarly, that a decline in PA was also predictive of greater rumination at the next measurement (ϕPA→Rum; B = − 0.078). Thus, for both negative and positive affect, a within-person deviation from one's own mean level of affect was associated with a subsequent withinperson change in rumination. Surprisingly, no paths were found from rumination to either NA (ϕRum→NA; B = 0.038) nor PA (ϕRum→PA; B = − 0.029) meaning that rumination did not predict subsequent changes in affect.  The significant variance components in both models (see Ψ values) revealed marked individual variation in all the effects (see Table ). The correlations between within-level effects are visualized in Fig. . Blue connections represent positive correlations, and red connections represent negative correlations. Individuals with a higher average level of negative affect tended to have more moment-to-moment carry-over in their negative affect. This is evident in the positive correlation (r = 0.187) between the mean μNA and the autoregressive parameter ϕNA→NA. We also observed that when people ruminated to a greater extent in response to heightened negative affect, there was more moment-to-moment carry-over in affect. This appears in the positive correlation (r = 0.109) between the autoregressive parameter ϕNA→NA and the cross-lagged parameter ϕNA→Rum. Also noteworthy, the negative correlation (r = − 0.171) between the cross-lagged coefficient ϕNA→Rum and the autoregressive parameter ϕRum→Rum implies that when people ruminate to a greater extent in response to heightened negative affect, there tends to be less carry-over of rumination from one moment to the next. We also note the finding (although weaker) that less carry-over of rumination was associated with greater emotional inertia (ϕNA→NA and ϕRum→Rum; r = − 0.044), suggesting that reactive 3 Unstandardized model parameters are provided in supplementary materials 2.  An analysis of the data revealed that rumination does predict subsequent changes in NA and PA when excluding the between-level predictor HINT. This is consistent with prior findings (e.g.,  showing rumination to predict subsequent changes in affect. However, when accounting for the effects of HINT, and associated parameters, other paths become more predominant. rather than static levels of ruminative thinking tend to be associated with greater emotional inertia. Also, greater mood-linked rumination was to some extent associated with preceding rumination having less effect on mood (ϕNA→Rum and ϕRum→NA; r = − 0.046), suggesting that when mood-linked rumination is present, any ruminative thinking occurring prior to that tends to have a smaller effect on mood. Finally, the dynamic parameters were less intertwined for positive than negative affect, with only one significant association (see Fig. ). Mean μPA and the cross-lagged coefficient PA→Rum were negatively correlated (r = − 0.171), suggesting that greater rumination in response to decreased PA was associated with lower average levels of positive affect. Habitual characteristics and the relationship between affect and rumination across time For negative affect, HINT was significantly associated with larger cross-lagged parameters (ϕNA→Rum; B = 0.217; see Table ). This relationship is depicted in Fig.  which shows that when associated with greater trait habitual characteristics, a momentary increase in NA is more likely to evoke heightened rumination on the next measurement occasion. This effect corresponds to an increase of 0.015 (absolute value) in the cross-lagged parameter ϕNA→Rum for each point increase in HINT. Also, for positive affect, HINT was significantly associated with larger (negative) cross-lagged parameters (ϕPA→Rum; B = − 0.304). Fig.  shows that, for PA, larger negative coefficients can be found at the  Note. Pearson correlation, p < 0.001 '***', p < 0.01 '**', p < 0.05 '*' (alpha = 0.05).

This corresponds to a decrease of − 0.007 (absolute value) in the cross-lagged parameter ϕPA→Rum for each point increase in HINT. As evidenced by the standardized estimates, this effect was larger for PA than for NA. Finally, HINT was associated with higher average levels of NA (μ = 0.345) and lower average levels of PA (μ = − 0.197), indicating that when accounting for the temporal relationships, heightened habitual characteristics were associated with greater levels of NA and lower levels PA over the course of the EMA assessment period. HINT was not significantly associated with other parameters in the models. We followed these results with additional analyses to investigate the robustness of our findings. The current findings remained unchanged when the results were detrended to control for the possible influence of time on the measurements. 5 Ruminative brooding, when entered at the between level instead of HINT in the models above, was not a significant predictor of the cross-lagged parameter ϕNA→Rum (B = 0. HINT, ruminative brooding, and BDI-II were moderately correlated in the present study (see Table ). We therefore computed the above    Discussion The aim of the current study was to assess if the habitual characteristics of negative thoughts are related to the dynamic interplay between negative affect and ruminative thinking in the flow of daily life experiences. Momentary increased negative affect was prospectively associated with greater ruminative thinking at the next sampling occasion. This relationship was moderated by a measure of habitual characteristics of negative thinking, such that a stronger association was observed with greater levels of habitual characteristics (i.e., repetition, lack of conscious awareness and deliberate intent, mental efficiency, lack of control and self-descriptiveness). To our knowledge, this is the first explicit test of habit-goal framework of depressive rumination using mobile EMA assessment. These key findings replicate previous results  and extend them by showing that negative affect can trigger ruminative thinking in everyday life as a function of habit. These findings are consistent with the habit-goal framework of depressive rumination  which conceptualizes rumination as a response triggered by context (i.e., negative affect) rather than intentions or goals. Because habitual characteristics specifically predicted the degree to which individuals ruminated in response to negative affect, and not just average levels of momentary rumination, this suggests that depression vulnerability may be in the form of rumination being habitually triggered by contextual factors (without conscious awareness and intent), making it difficult to control. The results held when accounting for the shared variance of HINT with a cardinal measure of depressive brooding, indicating that HINT taps aspects of habitual rumination not fully captured by traditional trait measures of rumination. Although the brooding subscale of the RRS has often been considered a measure of habitual rumination, it focuses on the frequency of ruminative processing since respondents are asked to rate how often they have certain ruminative thoughts when they feel sad or depressed (rated on a scale of repetition from ""almost never"" to ""almost always; . Although habitual behaviours may frequently emerge, frequency alone does not mean that behaviour is habitual in itself . Behaviour that is repeatedly performed in a stable context, may gradually become a habit, that is controlled by contextual cues, rather than mediated by goals or intentions. Thus, habitual behaviours are also characterized by a degree of automaticity (i.e., lack of conscious awareness and deliberate intent, mental efficiency, and lack of control; . HINT is aimed to measure both the automaticity and repetition of negative thinking  and should therefore be associated with a measure of the context-response association between affect and rumination if it has become habitual. Consistent with this, the current study found that HINT was as a significant predictor of the temporal pairing between affect and rumination whereas the brooding subscale of the RRS was not. In our view, this underlines the additive value of considering habit-like automaticity of thoughts in the study of adverse consequences of ruminative thinking in daily life. Interestingly, although not specified by the habit-goal framework, the same pattern was found when assessing daily fluctuations in positive affect, showing that a deterioration of positive affect can also serve as a contextual trigger for ruminative thinking. Repeatedly experiencing a decline in positive affect whilst ruminating (e.g., when one's goals are persistently thwarted) might over time turn the deterioration of positive affect into trigger for subsequent rumination. Although this novel finding may suggest that the habit-goal framework ) is relevant to a broader spectrum of emotional experiences, it should be interpreted with caution. Although negative and positive affect are assumed to be independent constructs , they are also strongly correlated . It may be that positive affect influences rumination partly through its overlap with negative affect. Using larger samples, it would be interesting to explore the relative contribution of negative and positive affect when investigating the habitual nature of depressive rumination. Furthermore, it can be argued that this finding might to some extent reflect the effects of positive rumination (i.e., savoring; see  which has been found to be associated with heightened levels of positive affect. However, a momentary decline in positive affect (rather than increased levels) was associated with greater rumination, that was associated with lower average levels of PA during the experience sampling period, indicating adverse effects of ruminative brooding rather than savoring effects of positive rumination. According to the habit framework rumination only develops into a trait-like habit once negative affect and ruminative thinking are paired over time. It is therefore theoretically consistent to expect some to ruminate without engaging in habitual negative thinking and vice versa . Consistent with this, we found significant variation in the degree to which habitual characteristics of negative thinking were associated with the context-response association between momentary affect and rumination. Although not the main objective of the study, we also examined how our findings related to symptoms of depression severity. It is when rumination turns habitual that it is hypothesized to be more detrimental for people's emotional well-being . Consistent with this, we found that people ruminate in response to daily fluctuations in negative mood as a function of depressive symptom severity. This suggests that once rumination has become contingent on the emotional context (i.e., negative affect) people also tend to experience more severe symptoms of depression. Furthermore, when accounting for the shared variance of HINT with depressive symptoms, habitual thinking was no longer a significant predictor of the temporal pairing between NA and subsequent rumination. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that this finding might to some extent reflect an overlap in negative content of the self-report measures, it is also in line with theoretical accounts of habitual rumination and might suggest that the link between habitual thinking and the dynamic interplay of affect-rumination at the microlevel overlaps with depressive symptomology in a meaningful way . Interestingly, this pattern did not emerge when looking at decreased positive affect as a trigger for everyday rumination. Habitual negative thinking remained a significant predictor even when accounting for depressive symptomology, suggesting that it may represent a less maladaptive form of ruminative process, consistent with dimensional approaches to psychopathology . However, since depressive symptoms were not measured repeatedly over time in our study design, inferences of causality are precluded. Future studies should address this constraint using prospective designs, and specifically test whether the interplay between mood-triggered rumination and habitual thinking serve as predictors of depression status over time, confirming its role as a vulnerability factor (e.g., in groups with a recurrent history of depression). Habitual characteristics of negative thinking were not associated with emotional inertia (i.e., more carry over of mood from one moment to the next). Although not directly related, HINT was associated with the degree to which negative affect triggered subsequent rumination, which in turn was associated with greater levels of emotional inertia, as well as less carry-over of rumination from one moment to the next (see Fig. ). Although speculative, it is possible that an indirect relationship exists wherein habitual attributes facilitate greater mood-linked rumination, which in turn leads to heightened emotional inertia. In comparison, ruminating in response to deteriorating positive affect did not involve the same detrimental dynamic process of emotional inertia. This indicates that people recover relatively quickly when ruminating in response to decreased positive affect whereas when they ruminate in response to negative affect, they tend to get 'stuck' in their current negative emotional state. The finding that greater NA-linked rumination was associated with reduced carry-over of rumination, suggests that once rumination has become contingent on negative mood, it tends to vary more over time. Indeed, previous research has found momentary rumination to vary considerably over time  and recent findings suggest that a greater history of depression may be associated with more variable levels of rumination (i.e., less carry-over; . This is line with the habit-goal framework  which posits that once habitual, negative mood states induced by processes other than perceived goal discrepancy could trigger rumination (e.g., watching a sad movie), extending the range of situations that cue ruminative thinking. A particular strength of the study is the use of EMA assessment to capture rumination and affect in the flow of peoples' daily life experiences. This allowed us to test the effect of habitual characteristics on the temporal relationships between rumination and affect in an ecologically valid way (Myin-Germeys, 2018), which addresses limitations of previous studies  restricted to trait measures of rumination. Crucially, we revealed a dynamic interaction between rumination and affect that would not have been apparent using trait measures alone. This study also has limitations. Although we tested whether habitual characteristics influenced the strength of the temporal relationship between affect and rumination, the study does not address the developmental aspect of how rumination becomes habitual in the first place. According to the habit-goal framework  situational factors that systematically thwart important goals and contribute to low mood (i.e., chronic stress and abuse) and person-specific factors associated with a lack of flexible responding (i.e., restricted coping repertoire and cognitive inflexibility) are hypothesized to facilitate the formation of rumination as a habit. Future research should aim to elucidate whether such situational and person-specific factors govern the strength the habitual association between affect and rumination. Furthermore, research should strive to assess whether the strength of the habitual association changes longitudinally as a function of such influencing factors. The EMA assessment methodology presented in the current study is ideally suited to test these novel predictions. Another limitation has to do with the inference of causality. Although we found affect to influence rumination across time as a function of habit, it does not preclude other causal influences. Effect sizes in present study were generally moderate to small, indicating that other contributing factors might also cause affect to evoke a subsequent ruminative response. Further, there exist no reliable behavioural proxies to assess rumination as a habit. In the current study habitual qualities were inferred from self-report, limiting the inference of causality. Thus, the current findings highlight he need to clarify the unique role of habit in depressive rumination and the development of more specific behavioural measures of habitual rumination. It must also be noted that although participants were specifically instructed to answer EMA questions in the moment based on how they felt just prior to the alert, the order in which EMA questions were presented was fixed. Items pertaining to affect were presented first preceding the rumination items, which could potentially prime a response for the rumination questions. Future research should address this potential shortcoming by utilizing varied or randomized item order designs. Although the current study consisted of participants with a wide range of depression symptomology, it is unclear whether clinical depression differs dimensionally or categorically from non-clinical depression . It is therefore unclear if our findings would generalize to samples of individuals with a history of clinical depression. Majority of the sample were female students, limiting the generalization of the findings to males. We are working on replicating the current findings using a variety of experimental measures (see e.g.  and EMA assessment of rumination in diverse samples, including a history of clinical depression. Our findings should be viewed in the context of the clinical relevance of the habit account of depressive rumination . Interventions that modify individuals' beliefs and attitudes are unlikely to change habitual behaviours . Therefore, they may not be effective at changing habitual rumination, which could explain why rumination predicts a poorer response to standard cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT; . Given that rumination has become contingent on the emotional context (i.e., negative or positive affect), preventive and acute therapy of depression needs to target the context-response association between affect and rumination, not just the content of the ruminative thoughts. The ruminative response needs to be replaced with a more helpful way of responding (e.g. concrete thinking, mindfulness, relaxation) to develop new context-response associations . Promising interventions include cognitive bias modification (CBM; Hertel, Holmes, & Benbow, 2014) and rumination-focused CBT , that involve repeated training of alternative adaptive responses when faced with emotionally challenging situations. The findings of this study could be used to inform case conceptualization and treatment selection in future studies on the subject. We hypothesize that individuals with greater habitual rumination should respond more favorably to interventions such as CBM and rumination-focused CBT compared to individuals with less habitual rumination. Importantly, the EMA measurement strategy utilized in the current study could be used to test whether interventions are successful in reducing the habitual characteristics of the association between affect and rumination. This may provide information on the mechanisms of change during therapy and the predictive value of utilizing EMA measurement approaches in studying psychological well-being (see e.g. . Conclusion The present results suggest that depression vulnerability may be in the form of rumination being habitually triggered in response to momentary fluctuations in affect, consistent with the habit-goal framework of depressive rumination . Rumination may also be more detrimental when habitual because it leads to a greater persistence of dysphoric mood (i.e., emotional inertia) and more fluctuating levels of ruminative responding. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the role of habitual characteristics in the dynamic interplay between rumination and affect in daily life using EMA methodology. Our findings begin to outline how habits may emerge as a dynamic relationship between rumination and affect across time, that would not have been revealed with traditional trait measures alone. We hope that future research will expand on these findings and explore if assessing and targeting the habitual attributes of ruminative thinking can inform treatment selection and boost treatment response, thereby reducing suffering and depression vulnerability.

9,9,"Effort, avolition and motivational experience in schizophrenia: Analysis of behavioral and neuroimaging data with relationships to daily motivational experience","Recent research suggests that schizophrenia is associated with reduced effort allocation. We examined willingness to expend effort, neural correlates of effort allocation, and the relationship of effort to daily motivational experience in schizophrenia. We recruited 28 individuals with schizophrenia and 30 controls to perform an effort task during fMRI. Individuals with schizophrenia also completed an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol. Individuals with schizophrenia with high negative symptoms were less willing to expend effort for rewards. Daily EMA assessments of motivation were positively associated with effort allocation at a trendlevel. Individuals with schizophrenia and controls displayed similar increases in BOLD activation in frontal, cingulate, parietal, and insular regions during effort-based decision-making. However, negative symptoms were associated with reduced BOLD activation in bilateral ventral striatum. These results replicate previous reports of reduced effort allocation in schizophrenia patients with severe negative symptoms, and provide evidence for the role of ventral striatum in effort impairments.","[""affective neuroscience"", ""cognitive neuroscience"", ""decision making"", ""neuroimaging"", ""schizophrenia""]",10.1177/2167702620901558,"Introduction: Many individuals with schizophrenia experience prominent negative symptoms, such as reductions in motivation, as well as decreased initiation and pursuit of goals. Such symptoms are associated with worse social and occupational functioning in those with schizophrenia, and thus motivational impairment represents an important target for treatment . However, current intervention strategies are, at best, marginally effective at treating these symptoms. Poor treatment efficacy may stem from inadequate mechanistic understanding of factors that give rise to motivational impairment in schizophrenia. While many potential contributory mechanisms have been proposed in the literature , recent work has examined the possibility that motivational impairment in schizophrenia might arise due to aberrant effort-based decision-making . Effort-based decision-making refers to mental calculations that individuals perform to estimate the costs and benefits of engaging in a particular action. For example, a student might estimate the subjective cost of studying an additional hour in hopes of achieving a better grade on an upcoming exam. Importantly, there are individual differences in effort estimates (e.g., some students might find the extra study time worth the prospect of a higher grade and thus expend the effort while others may not). Recent clinical research has found that individuals with schizophrenia are less willing than healthy controls to exert effort to obtain monetary rewards on experimental tasks . Many studies have also shown that this deficit in effort exertion is linked to clinician-rated  and ambulatory assessments  of motivational impairment in those with schizophrenia, such that schizophrenia patients with prominent motivational impairment demonstrate the least willingness to exert effort. Taken together, previous literature has highlighted aberrant effort-based decision-making as a potential contributory mechanism for motivational impairment in people with schizophrenia. Alongside clinical research, work in basic neuroscience has begun to delineate the neural circuits associated with effort-based decision-making. In the animal literature, there is consistent evidence that striatal dopamine is critically linked to effort allocation , such that rodents depleted of striatal dopamine show reduced willingness to perform effortful tasks for rewards. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has also been implicated in the integration of reward and cost information in the context of decision-making , and specifically ablation of the ACC in rodents has been shown to reduce choice of high effort options. In humans, neuroimaging studies have found that blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activation in the ventral striatum (a region highly innervated by dopaminergic signals) varies as a function of effort . Further, the dorsal ACC has been shown to integrate reward and cost information of potential actions , suggesting a central role for this region in selecting and maintaining effortful action. Finally, the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) has been shown to be critical to valuation of actions . Taken together, cortico-limbic-striatal circuits appear critical to effective effort-based decision-making. A limited number of studies have examined the neural correlates of effort-based decisionmaking deficits in schizophrenia. One study used a button-press paradigm where individuals decided between performing an easy button-pressing task for a small reward or a hard button-pressing task for large reward during neuroimaging . They found that individuals with schizophrenia showed lower BOLD activation of cingulate, ventral striatum, and medial frontal gyrus compared to healthy controls during decision-making. Similarly, although not a direct examination of the neural correlates of effort-based decisionmaking, , demonstrated that BOLD activation in ventral striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during reward processing positively correlated with behavioral measures of increased willingness to exert effort in those with schizophrenia . Thus, plausible regions of interest for the neural correlates of effort-based decision-making deficits in schizophrenia may be lateral frontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and ventral striatum. Although studies have consistently demonstrated reduced willingness of individuals with schizophrenia to exert effort for monetary rewards, with some exceptions , several open questions remain in the literature. First, while diagnostic group differences are consistently reported, relationships between negative symptom severity in those with schizophrenia and effort allocation are less consistent. Thus, it is important to conduct additional studies to examine symptom relationships in order to provide replication of previous results. Second, while some work has been conducted examining cognitive effort in schizophrenia , most studies have utilized physical effort-based decision-making tasks, and it is not currently known whether physical and cognitive effort-based decision-making are associated with similar or disparate psychological processes and neural circuits . Thus, it is important to examine non-physical tasks in order to observe whether symptom and diagnostic group effects generalize across effort modality. Third, only one study to date has examined whether effort deficits measured in the lab show relationships to more ecologically-valid assessments of motivation and emotionality , and tying experimental findings to daily motivational experience remains an important avenue for future research. Finally, while preliminary evidence suggests that patient deficits on effort-based decision-making tasks may be related to hypoactivation of striatum, cingulate, and lateral prefrontal cortex , more research is needed examining the neural correlates of effort-based decision-making in people with schizophrenia. In the current study, we collected neuroimaging data, recruiting both healthy controls and those with schizophrenia to complete a well-validated cognitive effort-based decisionmaking task, the cognitive effort-discounting task (COGED) . Further, we collected ambulatory assessments of enjoyment and interest in daily activities of those with schizophrenia in order to observe whether willingness to expend effort and the neural correlates of effort-based decision-making were associated with interest and enjoyment measured outside the lab. First, we examined whether individuals with schizophrenia were less willing than healthy individuals to exert effort for monetary rewards. Given previous literature on aberrant effort-based decisionmaking in those with psychosis , we hypothesized that individuals with schizophrenia would be less willing than healthy controls to exert cognitive effort for monetary rewards, even after controlling for task performance . Further, consistent with prior work, we proposed an individual differences relationship, such that those with schizophrenia with the greatest negative symptom severity would be the least willing to exert effort . In addition, we proposed that this reduced willingness to expend effort would be associated with measures of enjoyment and interest collected in daily life, such that those with schizophrenia who were least willing to engage with effort on experimental paradigms would also show the least interest and enjoyment in activities of daily life . As a second aim, we also sought to gain preliminary evidence of the neural correlates of effort-based decision-making impairments in those with schizophrenia using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Consistent with previous literature , we hypothesized that BOLD activation in cingulate cortex and frontal cortex would be enhanced across both healthy controls and those with schizophrenia during putatively difficult effort-based decisionmaking trials when compared to putatively easy trials. However, we hypothesized that individuals with schizophrenia would show less robust recruitment of striatum, cingulate, and frontal cortex during putatively difficult compared putatively easy effort-based decisionmaking trials and that activation in these regions would negatively correlate with motivational impairment. Methods: Participants Study participants included 28 individuals meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 30 demographically matched healthy control participants with no personal or family history of psychosis   ; (f) MRI contraindications; (g) personal or family history of psychosis; (h) current prescription of psychotropic medications. All participants were required to pass a urine drug screen prior to study participation. The Washington University Institutional Review Board approved the study, and participants provided written, informed consent in accordance with Washington University's Human Subject Committee's criteria. Clinical Ratings Diagnoses were determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR . Negative symptoms were assessed using the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS)  conducted by either a Masters or Ph.D. level clinician. Converging structural analyses of the CAINS have identified two moderately correlated factors, one reflecting experiential impairments (anhedonia, asociality, avolition) and the other reflecting expressive impairments (alogia, blunted affect) . These factors are now reflected in two subscales of the CAINS, Motivation and Pleasure Subscale (CAINS-MAP) and Expressive Subscale (CAINS-EXP) . Given the hypothesized relationship between effort allocation and motivational impairment, CAINS-MAP was the focus of the current report. Ecological Momentary Assessment Protocol Participants with schizophrenia were provided an Android-enabled smartphone during the EMA portion of the study. During the seven-day protocol, participants received four text messages per day between 10:00 a.m. and 8 p.m., approximately every two to three hours. Text messages contained hyperlinks to a Qualtrics online survey . Following the receipt of each text message, participants were given 15-minutes to begin each survey. Participants were paid $1.75 for each survey they completed within this 15-minute window. The protocol was identical to a previously published study by our group . On each survey, participants were asked to indicate their current activities from a predetermined list of options (i.e., eating/drinking, TV/radio/computer/reading, entertainment away from home, socializing, exercising, work/school, sleeping, running an errand, cleaning/hygiene/chores, cooking, therapy/doctor's appointment, in transit, nothing in particular). Next, they indicated the (a) level of interest; (b) level of enjoyment they experienced from these activities on a 5-point point ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). Additionally, participants were asked to indicate their activities, level of interest, and level of enjoyment (a) since the last text message (i.e., in the last 2-3 hours) as well as (b) for what they expected to do in the upcoming 2-3 hours. Current, past, and future self-reports were averaged for each survey for interest and enjoyment, for all analyses creating a single EMA Enjoyment and Interest measure per time point (e.g., 28 potential data points per subject), EMA-EI. Averaging of the EMA survey questions was performed to closely mirror current experiential subscales of negative symptom interviews (e.g., CAINS-MAP), which assess interest and enjoyment with current, previous, and future activities. Overall, the EMA protocol was well tolerated (mean completion rate = 78%). Consistent with previous EMA research ( , all participants completed at least 33% of surveys and thus were included in the present analyses. EMA adherence was not significantly related to CAINS-MAP (r-value = 0.04; pvalue = 0.83). Behavioral Cognitive Effort Discounting (COGED) Task Participants completed a modified version of the Cognitive Effort Discounting Task (COGED) , originally developed by Westbrook and colleagues . In this task, participants first practice increasingly difficult versions of a cognitively demanding task (N-Back: 1-4 back). Participants completed two 64-trial runs of each N-back level; each run consists of 16 target trials and 48 non-targets. Next, individuals made a series of choices about repeating one task up to 10 more times for cash rewards. Specifically, each decision trial involved a twoalternative forced-choice between completing a more demanding level of the N-back (2-4 back) for a greater reward or a less demanding level (1-back) for a smaller reward. After each choice the reward amount for the 1-back was titrated until participants were putatively indifferent between the base offer for the harder task and the offer for the 1-back (Figure ). This indifference point was then divided by the base offer amount for the hard task in order to quantify a subjective value for each hard task-base amount pair. Greater subjective value scores suggest greater willingness to exert effort. Critically, participants are instructed that they only need to perform as well on the N-back tasks as they performed during the practice phase to receive payment, helping to reduce any confounds associated with group or individual differences in performance levels. In the current study, three high-demand N-back levels (N = 2-4) and 2 base reward amounts ($2 and $4) were used. Each task amount pair was titrated over a series of five decision trials yielding a total of 30 decision-making trials and 6 indifference points across the task. Following scanning trials, one of the participant's choices was selected at random, to determine the task that they were required to repeat and the amount they were paid. Neuroimaging Cognitive Effort Discounting Task During fMRI scanning, participants made similar decisions between repeating a more cognitively demanding level of the N-back (2-4 back) for a greater reward ($2 or $4) or a less cognitively demanding (1-back) level for a smaller reward (Figure ). First, one taskamount pair was presented in the center of the screen for three seconds (valuation phase). Participants were told to consider how they felt about performing the task for the amount offered. After a jittered inter-stimulus interval (zero, two, or four seconds), an additional task-amount pair appeared on the screen and the participant chose which task they would rather perform for the amounts provided using a button box (decision-making phase). Finally, a jittered inter-trial interval (two, four, six second) occurred prior to the onset of the next trial. Importantly, offers for the easy task were offered at various degrees above and below subject-specific indifference points (100% below, 20% below, 10% below, 40% above, 60% above, 100% above) calculated prior to scanning. This allowed for manipulation of choice difficulty, as trials that are presented closer to indifference points are putatively more difficult decisions. In total, the fMRI protocol consisted of 72 trials. These trials varied by hard task amount offer (i.e., $2 or $4), hard task N-back level (2-4 back), and proximity to indifference point (100% below, 20% below, 10% below, 40% above, 60% above, 100% above). Specifically, two hard task load level trials were presented for each proximity level. Hard task amount offers were split such that $2 offers were presented during 10% below, 40% above, and 100% above indifference point levels and $4 offers were presented during 100% below, 20% below, and 60% above load levels. Thus, the design was not completely balanced across load level, proximity, and hard task amount. The main contrast of interest was between trials offered either 100% above/below indifferences points that are thought to be putatively easy trials and trials offered in between (e.g., 20% below, 10% below, 40% above, 60% above) which are thought to be more difficult (Figure ). Neuroimaging Preprocessing Images were acquired on a 3T Siemens Skyra system with a 32-channel head coil, which was customized and used for the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Structural scans (0.8 mm isotropic) as well as 3 functional runs using a multiband echo-planar sequence (TR=720ms, TE=33.1ms, flip angle =52°, 2.4 mm isotropic voxels, with a multi-band acceleration factor of 8). Each run was approximately 5 minutes in length. Imaging data was run through HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines . Subsequently, data was analyzed using the Analysis of Functional NeuroImages software package (AFNI: Cox, Chen, Glen, Reynolds, & Taylor, 2017). Binary masking was applied to each image to remove voxels outside the brain. The EPI datasets for each participant were smoothed using an 8-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Six rigid body motion parameters were used as regressors to correct for motion. Data Analysis COGED Behavior-Subjective effort costs were quantified as the subjective value of discounted rewards. Specifically, the indifference point for a given task-amount pair was divided by the base amount to yield a subjective value. If, for example, a participant was indifferent between $1.43 for the 1-back and $2 for the 2-back, then the subjective value for the $2, 2-back pair would be $1.43/$2 = 0.715. Thus, greater subjective value estimates equal greater willingness to choose the high effort option. A hierarchical linear model was used to test for group differences in discounting, accounting for the hierarchical nesting of indifference points within participants. Specifically, subjective value was predicted by Nback level, diagnostic group, and their interaction. Hard task reward amount was not found to significantly predict subjective value and did not explain additional variance to justify added complexity to the HLM. Thus it was removed as a predictor in all analyses. To examine whether negative symptoms varied as a function of effort allocation, a second HLM was implemented using only the data from those with schizophrenia. In this model, subjective values were predicted by task level, CAINS-MAP, and their interaction. Supplemental analyses were conducted in order to quantify whether task performance was driving diagnostic and negative symptom effects on effort allocation. In short, we wanted to assess whether individuals were less willing to engage in demanding task levels simply because they were worse at the task. Thus, we conducted two additional analyses that included average N-back performance across task levels (d-prime) as an additional predictor of subjective value in the models described above. Finally, we conducted analyses to determine whether effort allocation was related to interest and enjoyment in daily activities measured via EMA. For these analyses, subjective value estimates for each participant were averaged creating a summary score of COGED decisionmaking, area under the curve. Area under the discounting curve (AUC) connecting subjective values across all levels provides a summary measure of mean willingness to expend cognitive effort for reward. We conducted one hierarchical linear model predicting EMA-EI by AUC. Further, given strong evidence of group differences for 2-back subjective value (Figure ), we conducted a supplemental analysis where EMA-EI was predicted by subjective value at the 2-back. COGED Imaging-Each participant's fMRI data was analyzed with a general linear model (GLM) using AFNI software. Separate regressors including a single regressor for BOLD activity during the evaluation phase, as well as separate regressors for each trial type (easy vs. hard trial) during the decision-making phase were modeled using an assumed hemodynamic response (GAM function). Six absolute motion parameters were also included. A contrast comparing hard vs. easy decision trials was created. For this GLM, we conducted a region of interest (ROI) analysis in AFNI using an a priori mask including regions from a prior analysis of an identical contrast ) (Table ). Further, we included bilateral dorsal striatum defined from AFNI atlases, and bilateral ventral striatum ROIs were created using a 8-mm sphere placed at peak coordinates (+/−10,8,−4) based on a previous study examining the neural correlates of reward learning in schizophrenia patients . Mean percent signal change for each participant for each ROI and condition (easy/hard decision-making trial conditions) were extracted using the AFNI 3dmaskave program. In addition to the primary ROI analyses, we conducted exploratory whole-brain analyses to examine task effects and group differences in the hard vs. easy decision-making trial contrast. Whole-brain statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using AFNI ClustSim program to determine cluster and activation thresholds (Table ) . To examine whether negative symptoms or discounting behavior (AUC) varied as a function of BOLD activation, we conducted bivariate correlations between AUC, CAINS-MAP, and BOLD activation in ROIs for the hard vs. easy contrast in schizophrenia group only. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was utilized to control for multiple comparisons . Power Analysis-For within group correlations between symptoms, BOLD activation, and effort-based decision-making task performance we had approximately 75% power to detect an effect of r = 0.4 or greater. For t-tests assessing group differences, we had approximately 73% power to detect a medium-sized effect (Cohen's d = 0.6). Finally, HLM analyses are most accurately calculated using simulations. These simulations revealed approximately 75% power to detect an effect size of r = 0.4 or greater when testing whether a single variable (e.g., BOLD activation in a particular ROI or COGED choice behavior) predicted EMA self-report. Results The groups did not significantly differ in age, gender, ethnicity, or parental education. The SZ group reported significantly less personal education than the HC group (Table ). Medication information and negative symptom severity of SZ patients is also listed in Table . COGED Behavioral Results Both SZ and HC participants discounted reward offers for higher levels of the N-back task, and did so in a mostly monotonic fashion (Figure ). Thus, participant discounting was sensitive to task load, and subjective costs increased with objective demands, as expected. SZ participants discounted rewards more than HC participants (Table ), suggesting greater effort aversion in those with schizophrenia (Figure ). Diagnostic group differences appeared to be largely driven by steep discounting of rewards by individuals with SZ compared to HC at the 2-back (Figure ), though the interaction between diagnostic group and N-back level was not significant. In order to determine whether the severity of experiential negative symptoms (CAINS-MAP) predicted discounting behavior, we conducted a second hierarchical linear model predicting subjective value for each task amount pair from N-back level, CAINS-MAP, and their interaction (Table ). Negative symptom severity negatively predicted subjective value, suggesting that willingness to expend effort was lowest in the high negative symptom patients. Scatterplots illustrating the relationship between negative symptoms and effort can be found in Figure  & 1C. We wanted to assess whether individuals with schizophrenia were less willing to engage in demanding task levels at least in part because they are worse at the task. Thus, we conducted two analyses that included average N-back performance across task levels (d-prime) as a predictor of subjective value in the models described above. In these models, diagnostic group was a trend-level predictor of subjective value, suggesting that cognitive impairment is likely a partial contributor to the diagnostic group differences seen in effort allocation (Table ). In contrast, negative symptom severity remained a significant predictor of subjective value even when controlling for task performance (Table ). Finally, levels of interest and enjoyment with daily activities measured via EMA were not significantly predicted by willingness to expend effort on COGED (COGED-AUC) (beta = 0.53, standard error = 0.45, t-value = 1.18, p-value = 0.24). However, prediction of interest and enjoyment in daily activities was trend-level significant for 2-back subjective value, where group differences are most robust (beta = 0.75, standard error = 0.40, t-value = 1.86, p-value = 0.08). Neuroimaging Results Behavioral Quality Control Analyses for Correct Identification of Indifference Points-Decision-making for neuroimaging task trials generally suggested valid identification of indifference points (Supplemental Materials S5 & S6). Specifically, when individuals were presented with 1-back offers below their subject-specific indifference points they tended to choose the hard task and when presented 1-back offers above indifference they tended to choose the easy task (Supplemental Materials S5). Further, reaction time for easy trials, which putatively require less deliberation, was faster than hard trials across both groups (Supplemental Materials S6). Main Effect of Task Across Groups-Neuroimaging analyses focused on a contrast of putatively hard (e.g., where participants find $2 for 3-back vs. $1 for 1-back to be close in subjective value) compared to putatively easy (e.g., $2 for 3-back vs. $0 or $2 for 1-back, where subjective offer values are far apart) decision-making trials. Across participants, BOLD activation in a priori ROIs located in cerebellar, frontal, cingulate, parietal, and insular cortices was greater during decision-making of difficult compared to easy trials (Table ), consistent with a previous report using a similar design with an identical contrast . Striatal ROIs did not show significant effects in this contrast (Table ). Follow-up whole-brain analyses revealed significant effects in similar regions when compared to ROI analyses. Specifically, posterior parietal/occipital cortex, middle cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, left postcentral gyrus, and left precuneus showed increased BOLD activation during difficult compared to easy decisions (Table ). Increased BOLD activation was found for dorsal striatum during putatively difficult compared to putatively easy decision-making trials, but this effect did not survive multiple comparison correction. Diagnostic Group Differences-Diagnostic group differences in a priori ROIs were largely not significant when comparing putatively difficult to putatively easy decisionmaking trials (Table ). While healthy controls showed greater BOLD activation on hard vs. easy trials compared to those with schizophrenia in the right inferior frontal gyrus, this effect was only marginally significant and did not survive multiple comparison correction. Follow-up whole brain analyses did not reveal significant differences between groups in the contrast of interest (hard vs. easy) when correcting for multiple comparisons. Individual Differences-Negative symptoms severity in those with schizophrenia showed robust correlations with BOLD activation in both left (r = −0.50, p-value = 0.006) and right (r = −0.54, p-value = 0.004). ventral striatum during putatively difficult compared to putatively easy decisions (Figure ; see Table  for correlations). Correlations remained significant after applying FDR correction. Specifically, high negative symptom patients showed decreases in BOLD activation for hard compared to easy decision trials, whereas low negative symptoms patients showed increases in BOLD activation. For the left ventral striatum, this effect was trend-level significant after an outlier was removed (r = −0.37, pvalue = 0.06). No other significant correlations were found between BOLD activation in a priori ROIs and negative symptom severity. Correlations between COGED discounting (area under the curve) and BOLD activation for the contrast of hard vs. easy trials in a priori ROIs was also examined. Here, a positive correlation was found between the left anterior insula and discounting behavior (Figure , however this correlation did not survive multiple comparison correction (Table ). No other significant correlations were found between BOLD activation in a priori ROIs and negative symptom severity. No significant correlations were observed between EMA variables and BOLD activation in a priori ROIs. EMA and task variables were not significantly associated with demographic variables. Further, correlations between BOLD activation in a priori ROIs and demographic variables were largely non-significant. For ROIs that showed significant associations with demographic variables, inclusion of demographic variables as a covariate did not alter the statistical significant of associations between BOLD activation and negative symptom severity (Table ). Discussion The goal of the current study was to examine effort-based decision-making in those with schizophrenia. Behaviorally, we found that individuals with schizophrenia were less willing than healthy controls to exert effort to obtain monetary rewards. Further, we observed that willingness to expend effort was associated with negative symptom severity, such that high negative symptom patients were least willing to exert effort for monetary rewards, even when controlling for task performance. Regarding neural correlates, we observed increased BOLD activation of frontal, parietal, cingulate, and insular regions during hard compared to easy trials across participants. Contrary to our hypotheses, we observed similar patterns of BOLD activation in both SZ and HC groups during effort-based choice. However, negative symptom severity in those with schizophrenia was significantly associated with reduced BOLD activation in bilateral ventral striatum during decision-making, and greater discounting was associated with greater anterior insula activity, although this effect did not survive FDR correction. These findings are discussed in further detail below. The findings of the current study are consistent with previous literature demonstrating decreased willingness of those with schizophrenia to expend effort for monetary rewards . Also consistent with several previous reports , we found that negative symptoms were associated with effort exertion, such that greater negative symptom severity was associated with a decreased willingness to exert effort. In addition to measuring negative symptoms with traditional clinical interviews, we also measured negative symptoms using an ecological momentary assessment approach, asking individuals with schizophrenia to self-report their interest and enjoyment with daily activities using a smartphone. Using a similar approach, our lab previously  found that people with schizophrenia who demonstrated the least willingness to exert physical effort on an experimental task also reported the least interest and enjoyment with their daily activities. Although the associations between cognitive effort-based decisionmaking and EMA variables in the current report were not as robust as in our prior work, we did observe a trend-level positive association. Limited power due to lower sample size may have contributed to non-significant findings in the current report. Similar to a previous report using a similar design , across participants, we observed increased BOLD activation in frontal, cingulate, parietal, and insular regions for hard compared to easy decision-making trials. Contrary to expectations, we did not observe significant effects in striatal regions for our overall contrast of hard compared to easy decisions. Several previous reports have found BOLD activation in ventral and/or dorsal striatum, which varies as a function of effort during valuation and decisionmaking . Thus, the lack of robust BOLD activation in the striatum for the present contrast is surprising. Contrary to our hypotheses, we observed similar patterns of BOLD activation for both HC and SZ groups for our contrast of hard compared to easy trials. These results are inconsistent with a recent report  that found blunted reward-related BOLD activation of dorsal and ventral striatum in schizophrenia participants as a group compared to healthy controls during effort-based decision-making. However, Park et al., found largely similar patterns of BOLD activation between individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls during estimation of effortful options . Aspects of the current experimental design may have limited our ability to observe strong group differences. Specifically, decision-making trials in our neuroimaging design were administered in a subject-specific manner, based on the individual participant's indifference points derived during the behavioral portion of COGED. Thus, each participant received different trials based on their own willingness to expend effort, resulting in different trial combinations in all participants. In future work, it will be important to include some standard trial types across participants to determine if more evidence of neural alterations emerge at the group level with comparisons well-suited to elicit group differences. In regards to individual differences, we did observe robust correlations between negative symptom severity and BOLD activation in bilateral ventral striatum, as well as a positive association between willingness to expend effort and BOLD activation in the anterior insula, although at a nominal level of significance. The current striatal finding is consistent with previous work  that demonstrated an association between willingness to expend effort and ventral striatal BOLD activation on a reward-processing task in those with schizophrenia. Further, the correlations observed in the current report are consistent with several previous reports that examined aspects of value-based decision-making and found blunting of VS BOLD activation related to increased negative symptom severity in those with schizophrenia . Interestingly, in these studies, while associations were found between VS BOLD activation and negative symptom severity, group differences in the VS between controls and those with schizophrenia were non-significant, similar to the current report. Future work could extend the current findings in several directions. First, while multiple studies have examined effort-based decision-making in schizophrenia , work has been limited to medicated patients in the chronic phase of illness. An important direction for future research remains in assessing individuals in earlier phases of illness, as well as anti-psychotic naïve individuals. Research including such patient groups will help to establish the potentially confounding role of anti-psychotic medications in effort-based decision-making deficits in schizophrenia, as well as help to determine whether effort-based decision-making impairments are present across illness course. Second, impairments in effort-based decision-making have also been found in other psychiatric disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder) . However, it remains unknown whether similar behavioral effort-based decision-making impairments across these disorders involve similar or disparate psychological and neural mechanisms . Transdiagnostic samples are necessary to determine such mechanistic questions, which could have important implications for development of novel intervention strategies to alleviate effort-based decision-making impairments. Finally, although effort-based decisionmaking impairments appear to be a robust deficit in those with schizophrenia, little work has suggested potential treatment approaches for improving effort expenditure. While future work is needed to better characterize the mechanisms that might give rise to aberrant effortbased decision-making in order to guide mechanistically-informed intervention, several promising interventions exist that could yield beneficial effects. For example, individuals with schizophrenia may show decreased willingness to expend effort, in part, due to negative beliefs about their ability to successfully perform actions , and such beliefs can be successfully targeted with cognitive behavioral therapy . The current study had several limitations. First, the sample size was modest and included individuals with schizophrenia primarily in the chronic phase of illness. Future work will be needed to replicate and extend the current findings in a larger sample. Second, we did not collect EMA measures in our healthy control group and this prohibits examination of more typical patterns of enjoyment/interest in daily activities. However, while such typical patterns are important, they were not necessary to the aims of the current analyses. Third, many of the participants with schizophrenia were taking anti-psychotic medications at the time of study completion, which may have influenced choice behavior due to influence on dopamine systems. Fourth, given the complexity of the EMA data, there are a multitude of potential alternatives for creating summary scores. In the current manuscript, we averaged together self-reported interest and enjoyment for current, past, and future daily activities within each EMA time point. Such an averaged approach has the benefit of assessing general hedonic and motivational experience, while limiting the number of statistical comparisons. However, it may be the case that specific questions, indexing particular aspects of hedonic and motivational experience, show stronger associations to task and biological variables. While we do not explore relationships between task variables and specific questions in the current manuscript, future research may benefit from attempting to relate task variables to more specific aspects of daily motivational experience. Further, future reports may benefit from examining daily motivational experience within particular behavioral contexts (e.g., social situations, during completion of effortful behaviors) in order to observe whether relationships. Finally, negative symptoms were partially assessed using the CAINS. Converging structural analyses of the CAINS have identified two moderately correlated factors, one reflecting experiential impairments (anhedonia, asociality, avolition) and the other reflecting expressive impairments (alogia, blunted affect) . Given the hypothesized relationship between effort allocation and experiential impairment, CAINS-MAP was the focus of the current report. A recent structural report has suggested a five-factor model of negative symptoms (i.e., anhedonia, avolition, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect; . While such a model was not utilized in the current report, future studies may benefit from examining relationships between willingness to expend effort and particular factors of this model (particularly avolition and anhedonia). In conclusion, the current study provides replication of previous work suggesting decreased willingness of those with schizophrenia to exert effort to obtain monetary rewards. Further, we showed that this behavioral deficit varies as a function of negative symptom severity, and that negative symptom severity in patients is closely associated with hypoactivation of ventral striatum during effort-based choice. Future studies are needed to further examine the neural correlates of effort-based decision-making in schizophrenia in larger samples, as well as to assess patients at various phases of illness. In addition, it will be important to further examine the psychological and neural mechanisms of effort-based decision-making in order to guide development of novel interventions.     "
10,10,Ecological Momentary Assessment of the Relationship between Positive Outcome Expectancies and Gambling Behaviour,"Relapse prevention models suggest that positive outcome expectancies can constitute situa-tional determinants of relapse episodes that interact with other factors to determine the likelihoodof relapse. The primary aims were to examine reciprocal relationships between situational positivegambling outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour and moderators of these relationships. Anonline survey and a 28 day Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) were administered to 109past-month gamblers (84% with gambling problems). EMA measures included outcome expectan-cies (enjoyment/arousal, self-enhancement, money), self-efficacy, craving, negative emotional state,interpersonal conflict, social pressure, positive emotional state, financial pressures, and gamblingbehaviour (episodes, expenditure). Pre-EMA measures included problem gambling severity, motives,psychological distress, coping strategies, and outcome expectancies.  No reciprocal relationshipsbetween EMA outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour (episodes, expenditure) were iden-tified.  Moderations predicting gambling episodes revealed:  (1) cravings and problem gamblingexacerbated effects of enjoyment/arousal expectancies; (2) positive emotional state and positivereframing coping exacerbated effects of self-enhancement expectancies; and (3) instrumental socialsupport buffered effects of money expectancies. Positive outcome expectancies therefore constitutesituational determinants of gambling behaviour, but only when they interact with other factors. Allpre-EMA expectancies predicted problem gambling severity (OR = 1.61_3.25). Real-time interventionsaddressing gambling outcome expectancies tailored to vulnerable gamblers are required. ","[""gambling"", ""outcome expectancies"", ""expenditure"", ""relapse"", ""smartphone"", ""ecological momen-tary assessme"", ""EMA""]",10.3390/jcm10081709,"Introduction The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition; DSM-5)  now classifies Gambling Disorder (pathological gambling) as an addiction and related disorder. In line with public health frameworks that view gambling problems as occurring across a continuum of risk , the term problem gambling is often employed to refer to any gambling that results in adverse consequences for gamblers, families, and communities . Estimates of the standardised global past-year prevalence of adult problem gambling range from 0.5 to 7.6%, with an average of 2.3% . Recent Australian national estimates indicate problem gambling rates of 0.4 to 0.6%, with estimates of a further 1.9 to 3.7% displaying moderate-risk gambling and 3.0 to 7.7% displaying low-risk gambling . Moreover, problem gambling is associated with a high burden of harm that is comparable to depression and alcohol use disorders . Harms most often occur across financial, relationship, and emotional domains, with smaller proportions of gamblers reporting physical health problems, cultural harm, reduced work or study performance, and criminal activity . Problem gambling is also associated with a range of comorbid mental health issues, including mood and anxiety disorders, alcohol and other drug use disorders, and personality disorders . The Relapse Prevention Model Originally developed to explain relapse in substance abuse, the influential socialcognitive relapse prevention model  proposes a classification of factors or situations that can precipitate or contribute to gambling relapse. In general, these factors are classified as covert antecedents (e.g., general stress, lifestyle imbalances, rationalisations and craving) and immediate determinants (e.g., high-risk situations, coping skills, outcome expectancies and the abstinence violation effect). The model assumes that lapses are immediately preceded by high-risk situations, broadly defined as any context that confers vulnerability to gambling (e.g., negative emotional states, interpersonal conflict, social pressure, positive emotional states, and non-specific cravings), but that cognitive and behavioural coping responses impact on self-efficacy to determine whether a high-risk situation culminates in a lapse. Moreover, the abstinence violation effect, combined with positive outcome expectancies, increases the probability of relapse. A reconceptualisation of the relapse prevention model  emphasises the non-linear and dynamic interaction between multiple stable and transient risk factors in high-risk situations to determine the likelihood of relapse, including background factors (e.g., dependence, family history, social support, and comorbid psychopathology), physiological states (e.g., physical withdrawal), cognitive processes (e.g., self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, craving, motivation, the abstinence violation effect), affective states, and coping skills. This model proposes that responses in high-risk situations are related to both distal risk factors (stable predispositions that increase vulnerability to lapse) and proximal risk factors (immediate precipitants that actualise the statistical probability of a lapse) operating within both tonic processes and phasic responses. Tonic processes, which indicate chronic vulnerability for relapse, often accumulate and lead to the instigation of a high-risk situation, thereby determining the initial threshold or ""set point"" for relapse. In contrast, phasic responses are situational cognitive, affective, or physical states that fluctuate across time and contexts and are conceptualised as high-risk situations that can activate lapses. Phasic responses also include momentary coping responses that can decrease the likelihood of an initial lapse. Tonic processes therefore determine who is vulnerable for relapse, while phasic responses are high-risk situations that determine when relapse will occur. The model incorporates feedback loops, whereby there is a reciprocal causation between cognitive processes (selfefficacy, outcome expectancies, craving, motivation), affective states, coping behaviour, and the addictive behaviour. There is considerable empirical support for the relapse prevention model across the addictions . In the context of gambling, however, components of the model lack ecologically valid empirical assessments due to a reliance on traditional cross-sectional methodologies that cannot capture phasic precipitants of gambling nor their dynamic interactions with other phasic or tonic precipitants of gambling in real time. Positive Outcome Expectancies Positive outcome expectancies play a central role in these relapse prevention models. Gambling outcome expectancies refer to the anticipated outcome one expects to gain as a result of gambling . It has been argued that expectancies are an association between mental representations in long-term memory that are automatically activated under specific circumstances . Accordingly, the relapse prevention model hypothesises that positive outcome expectancies become particularly salient in high-risk situations, whereby the possible delayed negative consequences of addictive behaviour are ignored or discounted in favour of the anticipation of immediate positive effects . This is consistent with alcohol expectancy theory, in which vicarious and direct experience with drinking and its consequences shape expectancies for alcohol-related outcomes . Systematic review evidence generally supports these assertions, although several factors, such as the measurement of alcohol consumption, the target populations studied, the temporal distance between types of outcome expectancies, and environmental context, may impact the observed relationship between expectancies and alcohol consumption . There is now consistent cross-sectional evidence across samples of varying ages, cultures, and settings that there is an association between problem gambling severity and related harms and positive outcome expectancies. Specifically, evidence indicates that problem gambling severity is associated with specific positive outcome expectancies, including enjoyment/arousal or excitement; self-enhancement, positive self-evaluation or ego enhancement; money or material gain; escape, negative affect, or sedating; and social outcome expectancies , as well as global positive outcome expectancies involving a belief that gambling will make one feel better . There is also limited prospective research that positive outcome expectancies (excitement, escape, and ego enhancement) predict subsequent gambling problems . Moreover, there is recent evidence of clinically and statistically significant reductions in a global measure of positive outcome expectancies following residential treatment . Ecological Momentary Assessment of Positive Outcome Expectancies This cross-sectional research, which is subject to recall bias, treats gambling outcome expectancies as stable, enduring traits, rather than transient or phasic responses . The reconceptualised relapse prevention model, however, suggests that transient changes in positive outcome expectancies can constitute phasic determinants of relapse episodes that interact with tonic processes to determine the likelihood of relapse . Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), which is an event-level longitudinal methodology, overcomes these limitations by repeatedly measuring symptoms, emotions, behaviour, and thoughts in real time and in natural environments . EMA methodologies, which maximise ecological validity and minimise recall bias, are particularly suitable for examining complex antecedent-consumption-consequence patterns . Although EMA methodologies are increasingly being employed in the gambling field , none have yet examined the relationships between situational (phasic) outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour. This is in contrast to other addictions literature, in which there is EMA evidence suggesting that positive outcome expectancies predict the occurrence and amount of smoking and alcohol consumption , moderate the relationships between other situational factors and the likelihood of drinking , play a mediating role between other situational factors and smoking/alcohol consumption , are associated with smoking self-efficacy and craving , and reduce non-smoking intentions . The Current Study An enhanced understanding of these in-the-moment relationships using EMA methodologies, as well as which gamblers are most vulnerable to outcome expectancies, have implications for the development of tailored interventions targeting positive outcome expectancies for preventing gambling-related harm. The primary aims of this study were therefore to: (1) examine the reciprocal relationships between phasic (EMA-measured) positive gambling outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour (episodes, expenditure) and (2) the degree to which phasic responses (EMA-measured self-efficacy, craving, negative emotional state, interpersonal conflict, social pressure, positive emotional state, and financial pressures) and tonic processes (pre-EMA-measured problem gambling severity, gambling motives, psychological distress, and coping strategies) implicated in the relapse prevention models  moderate the relationships between phasic gambling outcome expectancies and gambling episodes. Secondary aims were to explore the concordance between phasic (EMA-measured) and tonic (pre-EMA-measured) gambling outcome expectancies; and the degree to which tonic (pre-EMA-measured) positive gambling expectancies predict problem gambling severity. Materials and Methods Participants This convenience sample consisted of 109 adult, past-month gamblers (39 men, 1 unspecified sex) recruited from the Australian community. Participants were aged between 18 and 55 years (M = 28.11, SD = 7.77). The majority were Australian born (76.15%), had completed an undergraduate or vocational/trade qualification (62.39%), and were in paid full-or part-time employment (55.96%). The majority of participants had gambled on electronic gaming machines (EGMs) in the past 12 months (66.97%), followed by lotteries (64.22%) and instant scratch tickets (60.55%). Descriptive statistics for this sample are displayed in Table . Pre-EMA assessments were conducted via an online questionnaire administered via Qualtrics, which measured demographic and background characteristics (sex, age, country of birth, education, employment and past-year gambling frequency), as well as gambling and mental health variables. These measures were selected for their brevity and good psychometric properties, including high classification accuracy where appropriate . Problem gambling severity. Past-year problem gambling severity was assessed using the 9-item Problem Gambling Severity Index [PGSI; 3]. Items are rated on a 4-point scale, with response options ranging from (0) never to (3) almost always. Total scores range from 0 to 27, which can be classified into non-problem (score of 0), low-risk (scores of 1-2), moderate-risk (scores of 3-7), and problem (scores of 8-27) gambling . The PGSI has demonstrated excellent internal consistency, validity, sensitivity and specificity in previous research . Gambling motives. Gambling motives were measured using the 16-item Gambling Motives Questionnaire-Financial [GMQ-F; ]. The GMQ-F measures the frequency of gambling for reasons representing enhancement, social, coping, and financial motives. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale from (1) never or almost never to (4) almost always or always, with subscale scores ranging from 4 to 16. The GMQ-F subscales have demonstrated good internal consistencies (α = 0.64-0.84), as well as construct and discriminant validity . Psychological distress. Past-month psychological distress was assessed via the 6-item Kessler 6 Psychological Distress Scale [K6; ]. Based on scoring employed for Australian norms, items are rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from (1) none of the time to (5) all of the time. Total scores range from 6 to 30, which can be classified into low (scores of 6-13), moderate (score of , high (score of , or very high risk (score of . The K6 has demonstrated has demonstrated excellent internal consistency (α = 0.89) . Coping styles. Coping styles were assessed using the following 2-item subscales from the Brief-COPE [B-COPE; ]: active, planning, positive reframing, emotional support, and instrumental support. Items are scored on a 4-point scale ranging from (1) do not do this at all to (4) do this a lot, with subscale scores ranging from 2 to 8. These subscales have demonstrated adequate to good internal consistency (α = 0.64-0.73) . Gambling outcome expectancies. Gambling outcome expectancies were assessed using the 23-item Gambling Expectancies Questionnaire [GEQ: ]. The GEQ includes three positive expectancy subscales: enjoyment/arousal (8 items; enjoyment, excitement, and social opportunities from gambling), self-enhancement (4 items; gambling as an opportunity to feel good about oneself, either by impressing peers or establishing autonomy from others), and money (3 items; financial gain from gambling). Items are rated on a 7-point scale ranging from (1) no chance to (7) certain to happen, with subscale scores ranging from 1 to 7. The GEQ positive outcome expectancy subscales have demonstrated good to high internal consistency (α = 0.78-0.86) . EMA An EMA protocol was developed using a smartphone application (Instant Survey). This protocol employed both time-based sampling (i.e., semi-randomly prompting of individuals to input information about their internal states and ecological contexts) and event-based sampling (i.e., collecting data around a specific, discrete event, which in this case is a gambling episode). During a 28 day period, participants were prompted via push notifications to complete a time-based EMA (t-EMA) delivered through the app at random times during two pre-specified periods each day: morning (9:00 a.m.-12 p.m.) and evening (5:30-8:30 p.m.). Each t-EMA took approximately 1-2 min to complete. Each t-EMA included single items measuring positive outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, craving, negative emotional state, interpersonal conflict, social pressure, positive emotional state, and financial pressures. Given the lack of validated single items measuring the constructs identified in the relapse prevention models, we selected single items from longer, validated instruments that are well established in the literature, either on the basis of their factor loadings or their representation of constructs from the models. Positive outcome expectancies were measured using the item with the highest factor loading for each GEQ subscale : feel excited (enjoyment/arousal), feel powerful (self-enhancement), and win money (money). Participants rated the likelihood of each outcome expectancy on a 4-point scale, ranging from (0) very unlikely to (3) very likely. Gambling self-efficacy was assessed using the single self-efficacy item from the readiness rulers . Participants rated their confidence in their ability to resist an urge to gamble on a 4-point scale, ranging from (0) strongly disagree to (3) strongly agree. The remaining EMA items employed in this study (craving, negative emotional state, interpersonal conflict, social pressure, positive emotional state, and financial pressures) were measured using items adapted from the from the Inventory of Gambling Situations-Short Form . Each of these items was measured using a single item rated on a 4-point scale, ranging from (0) strongly disagree to (3) strongly agree. Finally, participants reporting a gambling episode within any t-EMA were administered an event-based EMA (e-EMA) measuring the occurrence of a gambling episode since the previous t-EMA, as well as gambling expenditure. Table  presents the EMA items employed, as well as the categories used for the data analysis.  (1) Lost $51+ How much money did you win or lost in total? If you broke even enter $0 18 categories ranging from $0 to $7501-10,000. Procedure Participants were recruited via convenience and snowball sampling using public advertisements, social media platforms, and online groups. Gamblers across the spectrum of risk were recruited given evidence that most of the burden of harm is attributable to low-and moderate-risk gambling . Eligibility criteria included being at least 18 years of age, owning a smartphone, and reporting having gambled in the past-month. Participants completed a 25 min pre-EMA online questionnaire, which confirmed eligibility via selfreport questions, gained informed consent, completed pre-EMA measures, and received EMA instructions. This was followed by the 28 day EMA protocol. Of the 373 eligible participants who provided informed consent and completed the pre-EMA questionnaire, only 126 provided valid EMA IDs that could be used to link their pre-EMA and EMA data. Of these 126 participants, 17 did not complete any t-EMAs. The final sample therefore consisted of 109 participants (29.22%) who were compensated with an AUD$20 e-gift voucher. Data was collected from May 2018 to July 2019. Ethics approval was obtained from the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee (2018-049). Data Analysis All data analyses were conducted using Stata 16 . There was no missing data within the pre-EMA survey due the use of forced-choice responses. Due to skewed distributions, clinical cut-off scores were employed when possible: PGSI (8+: non-problem gambling, problem gambling) and K6 (19+: low or moderate risk, high or very high risk). The remaining pre-EMA measures were dichotomised ad hoc based on response labelling. Specifically, given GMQ-F subscales are derived based on the mean of the relevant items, subscale scores were dichotomised to reflect on average whether participants had 'never or almost never' endorsed such an expectancy (mean scores of <2) or had endorsed such an expectancy 'sometimes/often/always or almost always' (mean scores of 2+). B-COPE subscales, however, are calculated by summing the relevant items. Subscale scores were therefore dichotomised to reflect whether participants had used each coping style 'a medium amount/a lot' for at least one item within the relevant subscale (scores of 5+), with scores of less than 5 reflecting that participants had used the relevant coping style not at all or a little bit across both subscale items (i.e., 'do not do this at all/do this a little bit). EMA outcome expectancies ('very unlikely/unlikely', 'likely/very likely'), gambling expenditure ('AUD$0-50 , 'AUD$51+'), and all remaining EMA items ('strongly disagree/disagree', 'agree/strongly agree') were also dichotomised. A series of mixed-effects binary logistic regressions with logit-links examined the reciprocal relationships between EMA outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour (episodes, expenditure). The magnitude of odds ratios (OR) for these main effects were interpreted according to established guidelines: small (OR = 1.68), medium (OR = 3.47), and large (OR = 6.71) . These analyses were repeated to explore moderation effects on the relationship between EMA outcome expectancies and gambling episodes using the relevant interaction term. In all of these analyses, EMA-measured independent and moderator variables were time-lagged to represent participant scores at the t-EMA immediately prior to the outcome of interest, and controlled for age, sex, time, and the outcome measured at the previous t-EMA. Significant interaction effects were explored using pairwise comparisons for marginal means. A series of Spearman's correlations were employed to examine the concordance between each pre-EMA GEQ item/subscale and its corresponding EMA item, which were interpreted according to established guidelines: negligible (r s = ±0.00 to ±0.30), low (r s = ±0.30 to ±0.50), moderate (r s = ±0.50 to ±0.70), high (r s = ±0.70 to ±0.90), and very high (r s = ±0.90 to ±1.00) . Finally, a series of ordinal univariate logistic regressions and an ordinal multivariate regression explored the degree to which pre-EMA GEQ positive outcome expectancy subscale scores predicted pre-EMA PGSI problem gambling severity categories. Significance was set at α = 0.05 for the primary analyses investigating the main effects relationships and any pairwise comparisons. However, a more conservative approach towards interpretation of moderation effects was employed due to the large number of moderators and potential for Type 1 error. Specifically, the manuscript presents only those moderation effects for which p < 0.03. While seemingly arbitrary, this threshold was considered to provide a reasonable balance between avoiding Type 1 error and Type 2 error, given the small number of participants in between-subjects analyses and the exploratory nature of these analyses. This approach has been employed by the research team in previous studies employing moderation analyses . Results Descriptive Statistics Presented in Table  are the descriptive statistics for the key pre-EMA variables, broken down by sex. Overall, 91 participants (83.49%) reported gambling problems across the continuum of risk: 25 participants (22.94%) were classified in the PGSI problem gambling category, 42 participants (38.53%) were classified in the PGSI moderate-risk gambling category, and 24 participants (22.02%) were classified in the PGSI low-risk gambling category. Sex differences on key variables were identified for BCOPE emotional support, with more women endorsing greater use of BCOPE emotional support, compared to men. There were no sex differences on PGSI problem gambling severity, GEQ gambling outcome expectancies, GMQ-F gambling motives, or K6 psychological distress. All pre-EMA scales displayed good internal consistency (α = 0.71-0.95). Overall, 3142 t-EMAs were completed (compliance rate = 51.47%), with participants completing a mean of 28.83 t-EMAs (SD = 22.07, range = 1-61). Within these t-EMAs, 381 gambling episodes were recorded (M = 3.50, SD = 6.47, range = 0-38).  Reciprocal Relationships between EMA Gambling Outcome Expectancies and EMA Gambling Behaviour Presented in Table  are the results of the mixed-effects binary logistic regressions. After adjustment for covariates and the outcome at the previous t-EMA, no significant regression effects were identified.  Pairwise comparisons for these significant interaction effects revealed that: (a) participants who reported experiencing high cravings had a higher probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed enjoyment/arousal expectancies (Figure ); (b) participants who reported problem gambling (vs. non-problem gambling) reported a higher probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed enjoyment/arousal expectancies (Figure ); (c) participants who reported experiencing a high positive emotional state (vs. low positive emotional state) had a higher probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed self-enhancement expectancies (Figure ); (d) participants who reported frequent use of positive reframing as a style of coping (vs. infrequent use) had a higher probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed self-enhancement expectancies (Figure ); and (e) participants who reported frequent use of instrumental support as a style of coping (vs. infrequent use) had a lower probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed money expectancies (Figure ). In these analyses, there were no statistically significant differences between participants who reported frequent use (vs. infrequent use) of planning as a coping style on reporting a subsequent gambling episode at either level of enjoyment/arousal expectancies (Figure ) or between participants who reported frequent use (vs. infrequent use) of emotional support as a coping style on reporting a subsequent gambling episode at either level of money expectancies (Figure ).  (a) Participants who reported experiencing high cravings (vs. low cravings) had a higher probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed enjoyment/arousal expectancies (p < 0.001). There was no difference between participants who reported experiencing an urge (vs. no urge) if they did not endorse enjoyment/arousal expectancies (p = 0.123). (b) Participants who reported problem gambling (vs. non-problem gambling) had a higher probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed enjoyment/arousal expectancies (p = 0.022). There was no difference between participants who reported problem gambling (vs. non-problem gambling) if they did not endorse enjoyment/arousal expectancies (p = 0.758). (c) There were no statistically significant differences between participants who reported frequent (vs. infrequent) use of planning coping on reporting a subsequent gambling episode at either level of enjoyment/arousal expectancies (unlikely: p = 0.311; likely: p = 0.241). (d) Participants who reported experiencing a high positive emotional state (vs. low positive emotional state) had a higher probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed self-enhancement expectancies (p = 0.034). There was no difference between participants who reported experiencing a high positive mood state (vs. low positive mood state) if they did not endorse self-enhancement expectancies (p = 0.290). (e) Participants who reported frequent use of positive reframing coping (vs. infrequent use) had a higher probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed self-enhancement expectancies (p = 0.012). There was no difference between participants who reported frequent (vs. infrequent) use of positive reframing if they did not endorse self-enhancement expectancies (p = 0.638). (f) There were no statistically significant differences between participants who reported frequent (vs. infrequent) use of emotional support coping on reporting a subsequent gambling episode at either level of money expectancies (unlikely: p = 0.786; likely: p = 0.071). (g) Participants who reported frequent use of instrumental support (vs. infrequent use) had a lower probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed money expectancies (p = 0.011). There was no difference between participants who reported frequent (vs. infrequent) use of instrumental support if they did not endorse money expectancies (p = 0.853). There was no difference between participants who reported experiencing an urge (vs. no urge) if they did not endorse enjoyment/arousal expectancies (p = 0.123). (b) Participants who reported problem gambling (vs. non-problem gambling) had a higher probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed enjoyment/arousal expectancies (p = 0.022). There was no difference between participants who reported problem gambling (vs. non-problem gambling) if they did not endorse enjoyment/arousal expectancies (p = 0.758). (c) There were no statistically significant differences between participants who reported frequent (vs. infrequent) use of planning coping on reporting a subsequent gambling episode at either level of enjoyment/arousal expectancies (unlikely: p = 0.311; likely: p = 0.241). (d) Participants who reported experiencing a high positive emotional state (vs. low positive emotional state) had a higher probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed self-enhancement expectancies (p = 0.034). There was no difference between participants who reported experiencing a high positive mood state (vs. low positive mood state) if they did not endorse self-enhancement expectancies (p = 0.290). (e) Participants who reported frequent use of positive reframing coping (vs. infrequent use) had a higher probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed self-enhancement expectancies (p = 0.012). There was no difference between participants who reported frequent (vs. infrequent) use of positive reframing if they did not endorse self-enhancement expectancies (p = 0.638). (f) There were no statistically significant differences between participants who reported frequent (vs. infrequent) use of emotional support coping on reporting a subsequent gambling episode at either level of money expectancies (unlikely: p = 0.786; likely: p = 0.071). (g) Participants who reported frequent use of instrumental support (vs. infrequent use) had a lower probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed money expectancies (p = 0.011). There was no difference between participants who reported frequent (vs. infrequent) use of instrumental support if they did not endorse money expectancies (p = 0.853). Correlations between Pre-EMA and EMA Gambling Outcome Expectancies Each EMA gambling outcome expectancy item was significantly correlated with its corresponding pre-EMA single-item (high range: r s = 0.94-0.98, p < 0.001), as well as its corresponding pre-EMA GEQ subscale score (high range: r s = 0.71-0.73, p < 0.001; with the exception of self-enhancement (moderate range: r s = 0.59, p < 0.001). Relationship between Pre-EMA Gambling Outcome Expectancies and Pre-EMA Problem Gambling Severity Table  displays the ordinal univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses exploring the degree to which pre-EMA GEQ subscale scores predicted pre-EMA PGSI problem gambling severity categories. In the univariate analyses, all pre-EMA GEQ subscale scores significantly positively predicted PGSI problem gambling severity categories: enjoyment/arousal (OR = 3.25, p < 0.001), self-enhancement (OR = 1.81, p < 0.001), and money (OR = 1.61, p = 0.002). Only enjoyment/arousal (OR = 2.67, p < 0.001) and selfenhancement (OR = 1.49, p < 0.018) expectancies, however, were significant independent predictors in the multivariate analysis.  Discussion This study is the first to employ an EMA methodology to examine the reciprocal relationships between momentary positive gambling outcome expectancies (enjoyment/arousal, self-enhancement, money) and gambling behaviour (episodes and expenditure). This study also explored the moderating role of other factors implicated in the relapse prevention models: phasic responses (EMA-measured self-efficacy, craving, negative emotional state, interpersonal conflict, social pressure, positive emotional state, and financial pressures) and tonic processes (pre-EMA-measured problem gambling severity, gambling motives, psychological distress, and coping strategies) ; the concordance between the phasic (EMA-measured) and tonic (pre-EMA-measured) positive outcome expectancies; and the associations between tonic (pre-EMA-measured) positive outcome expectancies and problem gambling severity. Reciprocal Relationships between EMA Gambling Outcome Expectancies and EMA Gambling Behaviour Contrary to the primary hypothesis, none of the positive outcome expectancies measured in the EMA were reciprocally related to gambling episodes or gambling expenditure. These findings challenge the relapse prevention models, which emphasise the role of positive outcome expectancies as precipitants to relapse and posit that there are feedback loops between transient changes in positive outcome expectancies and gambling episodes . They are also inconsistent with previous EMA substance use research demonstrating that these expectancies are phasic determinants of smoking and alcohol consumption  and previous cross-sectional research demonstrating a significant relationship between positive gambling outcome expectancies and problem gambling . Several methodological considerations may explain these findings. First, the items selected to represent each gambling expectancy item were measured using the item with the highest factor loading for each GEQ subscale . Although the GEQ consists of three discrete subscales of positive outcome expectancies, it has been acknowledged that the complexity of items identified within the enjoyment/arousal and self-enhancement subscales are not as discrete . Specifically, the enjoyment/arousal subscale includes items denoting enjoyment, excitement, relief from boredom, escape/tension reduction and social interaction, while the self-enhancement scale includes items reflecting potential outcomes of social gains as well as independence. It was that these subscales represent new ways of viewing gambling from an adolescent perspective, the sample for which the GEQ was developed. By selecting the highest loading item for each of these subscales, this study therefore appeared to measure the constructs of excitement (for enjoyment/arousal) and independence (for self-enhancement) in the EMA. This is supported by the current study's findings that the correlations between tonic (pre-EMA) and phasic (EMA) gambling outcome expectancies were significant, yet relatively low compared to what would represent good convergent validity, i.e., r > 0.70 . Moreover, noticeably absent from the GEQ positive expectancy subscales are items representing escape or tension reduction, which is considered an important determinant of gambling problems . Although the GEQ is one of the most commonly used measures of gambling expectancies in gambling research, future research replicating this study using items selected from a measure developed for adult samples with more discrete subscales, such as the more contemporary Gambling Outcome Expectancy Scale (GOES) , is required. Second, the failure to identify significant reciprocal relationships between positive outcome expectancies may be due to the use of a relatively small convenience sample of past-month gamblers. The sample size may have resulted in underpowered analyses involving time invariant factors and wide confidence intervals, particularly for expenditure data, which indicate reduced certainty in the results. The methods of recruitment, including social media platforms, may under-represent more vulnerable and socially excluded individuals, who are particularly vulnerable to developing gambling problems, and resulted in an over-representation of other population subgroups, such as fulltime students. Moreover, the assumptions underpinning the relapse prevention model, which were developed to explain relapse behaviour in people with dependence, were tested with a sample of pastmonth gamblers recruited from the community rather than a problem gambling sample. However, the majority (84%) of participants reported gambling problems, which allowed for the use of a problem gambling threshold for moderation analyses. Moreover, problem gambling moderated only one of the observed relationships, suggesting that there were few differences in the magnitude of effects dependent on problem gambling status. It is important to include gamblers across the spectrum of risk when exploring the mechanisms underlying gambling behaviour, given findings that the majority (85%) of the burden of harm associated with gambling problems is attributed to low-and moderate-risk gamblers due to their higher prevalence in the population . Alternatively, it may be that positive outcome expectancies measured as phasic responses do not display reciprocal relationships with gambling behaviour. As the first EMA study to explore gambling outcome expectancies, this study focused on the investigation of the reciprocal relationship between gambling outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour and the moderators of these relationships. As evidenced in the addictions literature , it may be that positive outcome expectancies either mediate or moderate the relationships between other situational factors and gambling behaviour. Given this emerging field of study, future studies are required to investigate the potential role of positive gambling outcome expectancies as mediators and moderators of the relationships between other precipitating factors implicated in the relapse prevention models and subsequent gambling behaviour. Moderators of the Reciprocal Relationships between EMA Gambling Outcome Expectancies and EMA Gambling Episodes While the failure to identify reciprocal relationships between positive outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour may be interpreted to suggest that the relapse prevention models are not as applicable to this behavioural addiction as substance use addictions, there is now evidence using EMA methodologies to suggest that gambling cravings and self-efficacy, which are other central cognitive processes implicated in the relapse prevention models, play a critical role in predicting gambling behaviour . Moreover, the associations between EMA positive outcome expectancies and subsequent gambling episodes were moderated by several phasic responses (EMA cravings, positive emotional state) and tonic processes (pre-EMA PGSI problem gambling, BCOPE positive reframing, BCOPE instrumental support). These findings therefore suggest that transient changes in positive outcome expectancies do constitute phasic determinants of gambling episodes, but only when they interact with these tonic and phasic processes . Specifically, the moderation analyses relating to enjoyment/arousal expectancies indicate that participants who reported experiencing high cravings or problem gambling had a higher probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed enjoyment/arousal expectancies. These findings suggest that anticipation of enjoyment, excitement, and social opportunities play an important role in predicting the likelihood of gambling for gamblers who are having gambling cravings or who have gambling problems. These findings highlight the importance of developing interventions to reduce these expectancies for problem gamblers, as well as real-time interventions to reduce these expectancies when gamblers are experiencing cravings. The moderation analyses relating to self-enhancement expectancies indicate that participants who reported experiencing a high positive emotional state or more frequent use of positive reframing as a coping style had a higher probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed self-enhancement expectancies. The finding relating to high positive emotional state suggests that anticipation that gambling provides an opportunity to feel good about oneself, either by impressing peers or establishing autonomy from others play an important role in predicting the likelihood of gambling for gamblers who report positive mood states. This finding highlights the need for the development of real-time interventions to reduce these expectancies when gamblers report high positive mood. The finding relating to positive framing, however, is somewhat counterintuitive, given that positive reframing is commonly conceptualised as an emotion-focused  or approach  coping style that is an adaptive response to stress . However, as a type of emotion-focused coping, positive reframing aims to manage distressing emotions rather than to deal with the stressor per se . Moreover, it has been emphasised that certain coping responses may be beneficial for some people in some situations, but less helpful for other people or in other situations . That is, positive reframing may not be intrinsically maladaptive, but may become dysfunctional in certain contexts. It therefore may be that, in the context of gambling, anticipation of feeling good about oneself plays an important role in predicting the likelihood of gambling for gamblers who tend to find something good in the situation because they minimise the negative consequences of gambling. Given that this construct was measured using a brief instrument administered prior to the EMA, future research that measures positive reframing in the EMA is necessary. The moderation analyses relating to money expectancies indicate that participants who reported frequent use of instrumental support as a style of coping had a lower probability of reporting a subsequent gambling episode if they endorsed money expectancies. This finding suggests that anticipation of financial gain from gambling plays a less important role in predicting the likelihood of gambling for gamblers who frequently seek advice, assistance, or information. In the context of gambling, instrumental social support therefore appears to be a problem-focused coping style  that plays a protective role by buffering the influence of money expectancies, suggesting that it may be important for interventions to enhance instrumental support as a coping style for gamblers who have high money expectancies. Relationship between PRE-EMA Gambling Outcome Expectancies and Pre-EMA Problem Gambling Severity Despite the failure to identify relationships between phasic (EMA) gambling outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour, the results revealed that all pre-EMA positive gambling outcome expectancies predicted problem gambling severity. These findings, which are consistent with previous cross-sectional gambling research , suggest that anticipation of positive outcomes from gambling, such as enjoyment, excitement, social opportunities, feeling good about oneself, and financial gain, is associated with the development of higher gambling problems. In the multivariate analyses, however, enjoyment/arousal and self-expectancies independently predicted problem gambling severity, while money expectancies did not. This finding is consistent with previous research in which money expectancies or motives did not contribute to the explanation of gambling problems when non-financial gambling expectancies or motives were taken into account . These findings suggest that although the chance to win money is central to gambling behaviour, anticipation of winning money is not the main explanation for the development of gambling problems. Instead, it appears that gambling for other reasons, such as gambling for excitement, to feel good about oneself, and to regulate mood, explain continued gambling in the face of increasing losses . There were no sex differences in gambling outcome expectancies in this study, which is not consistent with previous research that has found that males are significantly more likely than females to endorse positive outcome expectancies  and that gender moderates the relationship between some outcome expectancies and problem gambling severity . Given that sex differences have implications for the development of gendered treatment approaches, further research clarifying these results is required. While these findings suggest that positive outcome expectancies are an important risk factor for the development of gambling problems, they are based on cross-sectional associations. Longitudinal research is therefore required to explore the temporal relationship between these expectancies and problem gambling. These findings, however, add to the growing literature that positive gambling outcome expectancies are clear targets for prevention and intervention efforts. Since escape and enhancement expectancies appear to be more important than money expectancies, interventions may benefit by targeting these drivers of gambling problems. Study Limitations The study findings should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. As previously mentioned, limitations include the use of a sample of past-month gamblers recruited via convenience and snowball sampling who were required to own a smartphone, although problem, moderate-risk, and low-risk gamblers were over-represented (84% of the sample); an under-representation of males in the sample, who generally display a higher prevalence of gambling problems; a relatively small sample that may have resulted in underpowered moderation analyses and wide confidence intervals, particularly for expenditure data; and relatively low convergent validity of the expectancies EMA item with its corresponding multiple-item GEQ subscale . Other study limitations include low compliance rates (55.31%) compared to other EMA studies , measuring some constructs (coping and motives) articulated in the relapse prevention model as tonic processes in the pre-EMA survey; and the recording of e-EMAs in t-EMAs, which may have increased recall bias . There were also limitations associated with collecting self-report data, particularly in relation to gambling expenditure , although the use of EMA likely increased the accuracy of the gambling expenditure data; as well as a lack of more detailed clinical information relating to psychiatric comorbidities and general health, which have the potential to influence the findings. Future EMA studies would benefit from incentivising compliance rates, maximising convergent validity using alternative outcome expectancy EMA items, adding EMA items representing escape or tension reduction outcome expectancies, employing time-variant measures of coping and motives in the EMA, and employing user-initiated e-EMAs in large samples of participants with gambling problems. It would also be of interest to explore the potential role of gambling outcome expectancies as moderators or mediators between other situational factors implicated in relapse prevention models, such as affective states, craving, gambling self-efficacy, and gambling motives. Clinical Implications Nevertheless, the findings of this study have important clinical implications. They highlight the importance of targeting gambling outcome expectancies in gambling interventions. Psychological strategies derived from the relapse prevention models are generally behavioural or cognitive in therapeutic orientation, but increasingly include third wave approaches, including mindfulness-and acceptance-based strategies . Cognitive-behavioural interventions are considered ""best practice"" in the treatment of problem gambling , while third-wave strategies are emerging as promising interventions . Psychological strategies focusing on positive outcome expectancies within these interventions explore the validity and reality of outcome expectancies by contrasting the possible immediate positive consequences with the delayed negative consequences of gambling , as well as other strategies, such as personalised feedback . Meta-analytic evidence supports the efficacy of such expectancy challenge interventions for alcohol abuse prevention , as well as personalised feedback interventions for problem gambling . It may also be important for interventions to enhance instrumental support as a coping style for gamblers with high outcome expectancies and examine whether gamblers are inappropriately employing positive reframing as a coping style. Moreover, they indicate a need for interventions designed to target momentary positive outcome expectancies that change across time and contexts. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) are emerging mobile health (mHealth) intervention designs that address dynamically changing individual needs by providing the type and amount of support, at the right time, and only when needed . JITAIs leverage mobile and wireless technologies, such as smartphone-embedded or wearable sensors and EMAs to continuously monitor dynamic internal states and ecological contexts in real time to identify when and how support should be offered . Dynamic and individually tailored JITAIs that employ EMAs as their method of assessment have also been described as Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs) . JITAIs and EMIs have been effective in the broader mental health and addiction fields ; and have recently been adopted in the gambling field . For example, GAMBLINGLESS: CURB YOUR URGE  is informed by the relapse prevention model and aims to reduce gambling cravings to prevent subsequent gambling episodes. This smartphone-delivered intervention, which was adapted from GAMBLINGLESS, an evidence-based online self-directed program for gambling , tailors craving management activities to EMAs evaluating craving intensity; and also provides these activities on-demand. In line with the findings of the current study, such interventions could also be tailored to individuals most vulnerable to gambling in response to transient positive gambling outcome expectancies, such as problem gamblers, and delivered when they need the most support, such as when they are experiencing cravings or positive mood states. Accordingly, under development is a gambling intervention that builds on GAMBLINGLESS: CURB YOUR URGE by adding intervention strategies to reduce positive outcome expectancies and improve self-efficacy in high-risk situations. Delivered via a smartphone app, GAMBLINGLESS: IN-THE-MOMENT aims to provide tailored interventions to gamblers who report a state of cognitive vulnerability characterised by high craving intensity, low self-efficacy, and positive outcome expectancies in EMAs sent three times a day. Conclusions This EMA study provided important information about the role of positive outcome expectancies as phasic determinants of gambling behaviour. Although there were no reciprocal relationships between EMA-measured positive gambling outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour, several factors implicated in the relapse prevention models (cravings, problem gambling severity, positive emotional states, positive reframing coping, and instrumental social support) moderated the relationships between phasic gambling outcome expectancies and gambling episodes. These findings therefore suggest that transient changes in positive outcome expectancies do constitute phasic determinants of gambling episodes, but only when they interact with these tonic and phasic processes. Moreover, all positive outcome expectancies measured prior to the EMA period predicted problem gambling severity, although money expectancies failed to remain significant after accounting for the other positive outcome expectancies. These findings have important clinical implications, particularly relating to the development of real-time interventions that provide the type and amount of support when and where gamblers need it most.

11,11,Emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli interacts with momentary negative affect to predict nonsuicidal self-injury urges,"The current study investigated whether impaired emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli is a risk factor for real-time nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) urges. Participants were 60 university students with a history of repetitive NSSI. At baseline, participants completed an emotional stop-signal task assessing response inhibition to self-harm stimuli. Participants subsequently completed an ecological momentary assessment protocol in which they reported negative affect, urgency, and NSSI urge intensity three times daily over a ten-day period. Impaired emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli did not evidence a main effect on the strength of momentary NSSI urges. However, emotional response inhibition to self-harm images interacted with momentary negative affect to predict the strength of real-time NSSI urges, after adjusting for emotional response inhibition to neutral images.

Our findings suggest that emotional response inhibition deficits specifically to self-harm stimuli may pose vulnerability for increased NSSI urge intensity during real-time, state-level negative affect. Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is defined as intentional damage to one's body without suicidal intent . These behaviors are highly prevalent among youth; estimates suggest that 17.2% of community adolescents and 13.4% of young adults have a history of NSSI . NSSI is strongly associated with mental health, interpersonal, and academic problems (e. g., . Furthermore, NSSI engagement prospectively predicts suicidal ideation and behaviors , despite the lack of lethal intent that characterizes NSSI episodes. Understanding the etiology of self-injurious behaviors, as well as their proximal risk factors, therefore, is critical to enhance public health strategies aimed at reducing suicide rates, which continue to rise globally . NSSI urges, or the strong desire to engage in self-harm without suicidal intent, represent an understudied proximal risk factor for NSSI behavior. Past work has found that NSSI urges are associated with and/or prospectively predict NSSI behavior, both longitudinally and within everyday life . In addition to the relevance of measuring NSSI urges given their associations with NSSI behavior, prior theoretical work suggests that the experience of NSSI urges itself may be cognitively taxing, depleting finite self-regulatory resources . Recent research using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) supports this idea; Fitzpatrick and colleagues (2020) report that the intensity of daily-life NSSI urges predicts subsequent engagement in more severe NSSI behaviors (e.g., using different methods). The authors propose that resisting intense NSSI urges over long periods therefore might involve sufficient inhibitory demand to impede some people's ability to control NSSI behaviors once they have begun . Although a separate body of literature has established specific inhibitory control deficits in NSSI (e.g., , researchers have yet to fully explore the role of such deficits in the strength of NSSI urges, which may play a role in the link between NSSI thoughts and behaviors. Examining individual differences in cognitive control processes has begun to clarify pathogenetic mechanisms and clinical trajectories of potentially harmful behaviors and associated urges (e.g., alcohol cravings; ; the present study accordingly seeks to evaluate the role of such processes in NSSI. Studies using EMA to evaluate NSSI remain relatively rare, and even fewer have examined real-time urges to engage in NSSI, resulting in calls for greater empirical evidence on their distal and proximal precipitants (for reviews, see . However, extant EMA findings support the notion that people often use NSSI for emotion regulation purposes, specifically to reduce negative affect (e.g., . Such studies generally indicate that elevations in negative affect (NA) often precede episodes of NSSI urges and behaviors, and that engagement in NSSI typically is followed by decreases in NA . This is consistent with findings that affect regulation (c.f., intrapersonal negative reinforcement;  is the most commonly reported motivation for NSSI immediately following engagement in the behavior . Taken together, these EMA studies characterize NSSI as being accompanied by heightened daily and momentary NA, which may maintain nonsuicidal self-injurious thoughts and behaviors via negative reinforcement. Research also has examined whether underlying person-level vulnerabilities influence the likelihood that negative emotions will lead to NSSI urges and acts. Impulsivity is hypothesized to be such an underlying vulnerability factor that may facilitate acting on impulses to regulate emotions in maladaptive ways (see . Research consistently implicates one particular facet of impulsivity, negative urgency, in the experience of NSSI urges and behavior . Negative urgency refers to the tendency to engage in rash action in response to aversive affective states . Meta-analytic evidence supports the robustness of this association, which remains significant even after accounting for other impulsive traits, (e.g., sensation-seeking; . Furthermore, one of the few longitudinal studies focused on risk factors for NSSI onset found that high levels of self-reported negative urgency predicts NSSI initiation among college students . In the context of the intrapersonal negative reinforcement model of NSSI, negative urgency is proposed to augment the likelihood that an individual may experience and act on the urge to engage in NSSI when faced with NA (e.g., . In line with this conceptualization, an EMA study conducted among college students found that daily sadness predicted urges to self-injure most strongly among those reporting high trait levels of negative urgency . Despite the robust association between negative urgency and NSSI, research investigating the neurocognitive underpinnings of emotion-related impulsivity in self-harm is sparse. Furthermore, no EMA investigations of NSSI have included objective, behavioral metrics of impulsivity (e.g., measures of inhibitory control). More broadly, extant EMA literature in clinical science has insufficiently addressed interactions between state-level, within-person processes (e.g., affect) and between-person factors (e.g., inhibitory control) in the proximal prediction of real-world psychopathology, particularly using methodology other than self-report. A growing body of cross-sectional research has examined the nature and extent of behaviorally assessed response inhibition deficits associated with NSSI, given the putative relevance of impulsivity to these behaviors. In contrast to personality-based studies of impulsivity, most behavioral investigations find no performance differences between participants with a NSSI history and comparison groups on inhibitory control tasks (e.g., . Less work, however, has addressed ""hot"" executive functioning (c.f., affective control) in NSSI, including response inhibition in emotional contexts, despite conceptual links between this construct and urgency . The few studies evaluating emotional response inhibition in this population suggest that individuals with a history of NSSI may exhibit deficits in the ability to terminate ongoing motor impulses triggered by automatic reactions to negatively valenced stimuli . These findings fit with negative reinforcement models of NSSI, indicating that inhibitory difficulties may manifest only during periods of heightened NA, leading to impulsive cognition and behavior associated with relief from unpleasant affect.  provide a complementary explanation for impaired emotional response inhibition in NSSI, suggesting that such affective control deficits might represent latent psychopathology risk more broadly. The transdiagnostic nature of urgency, which is linked to a range of internalizing and externalizing disorders (e. g., , supports this notion that poor emotional response inhibition might make it difficult to inhibit both cognitions (e.g., thoughts, urges) and behaviors. However, it remains unknown whether the degree of emotional response inhibition impairment is associated with increased NSSI risk (e.g., NSSI urges), given that previous studies compared those with a lifetime NSSI history to those without any history of NSSI . Additionally, the cross-sectional nature of this research significantly limits inferences regarding the causal role of emotional response inhibition in NSSI risk and maintenance. Taken together, the above literature provides evidence that those who engage in NSSI may have difficulty modulating or inhibiting behavior in the context of undesirable emotional states, and, as a result, may be prone to experiencing urges to self-harm during occurrences of elevated NA and urgency. Notably, prior studies have focused mainly on trait-level impulsivity in NSSI (for reviews, see , whereas recent work suggests that state-level impulsivity particularly in affective and/or interpersonally-challenging contextsmay be equally or more relevant to self-injurious behaviors (e.g., . Moreover, only one prior investigation has examined emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli, reflecting another important gap in this area of inquiry. Specifically,  carried out a cross-sectional study comparing emotional response inhibition to self-harm images between young adults with and without a history of NSSI behavior. Contrary to study hypotheses, participants with lifetime NSSI history had better response inhibition than those without any previous NSSI when presented with self-harm images . The authors proposed that this unexpected finding might be due to positive implicit associations with NSSI (see  or desensitization through repeated exposure, despite finding that individuals with NSSI history generally categorized these images as ""negative"" in the behavioral task. This unexpected association may be attributable to study limitations, e.g., utilizing a cross-sectional design to compare participants without any history of NSSI to those with heterogeneous NSSI histories, a group with inherently greater familiarity with and exposure to NSSI (and its imagery). Thus, research is still needed to address whether the degree of emotional response inhibition deficits to self-harm stimuli impacts vulnerability to proximal contributors to NSSI risk (e.g., greater intensity NSSI urges; . EMA methodology is particularly well-suited to evaluate how NSSI-specific response inhibition impairment might manifest in the ""real world,"" by clarifying its relationship with hypothesized real-time precipitants of NSSI urges, namely, momentary NA and impulsive urges driven by heightened aversive affective arousal (i. e., feelings of state urgency in daily life). Accordingly, the current study evaluated the associations of occasion-level (i.e., momentary) NA and urgency with individuals' urges to engage in NSSI. In line with the negative reinforcement framework of NSSI maintenance, we expected that NSSI urges would be stronger at occasions characterized by high NA and high urgency. We further hypothesized that occasion-level NA would interact with occasion-level urgency to predict NSSI urge intensity, such that intensity of NSSI urges would be highest at moments characterized by both high NA and urgency. We then examined whether greater deficits in emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli strengthen the associations of NA and urgency with NSSI urges, given theoretical and empirical background suggesting that impaired emotional response inhibition may reflect a risk factor for future NSSI among those with a history of these behaviors. Following  original hypothesis, we predicted that individuals with worse emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli at baseline generally would report greater NSSI urge intensity over the EMA period. We also hypothesized that emotional response inhibition deficits to self-harm stimuli would moderate the associations of NA and urgency with NSSI urges, strengthening associations between occasion-level NA and NSSI urge intensity and between occasion-level urgency and NSSI urge intensity. Method Participants Participants in the current study were drawn from a sample of 123 undergraduate students at Temple University who completed an EMA study. Approximately half of the sample was recruited for a lifetime history of repetitive NSSI (n = 64) and half of the sample for a history of no engagement in NSSI (n = 59). Inclusion criteria for the NSSI + group included a minimum of two lifetime NSSI acts determined by self-report and a clinician-rated interview. Additional inclusion criteria stipulated that participants possessed normal or corrected vision, access to a smartphone, and endorsed fluency in English. The current study's primary analyses employ 60 participants drawn from the NSSI + group (1 participant was excluded due to non-completion of the Emotional Stop-Signal Task (ESST) and 3 participants were excluded due to less than 75% accuracy of valence judgments on the ESST; see . Participants were between the ages of 18-26 (M = 20.13 years; SD = 2.06) and the majority identified as female (n = 55; 91.7%). The racial composition of the sample was White (n = 41; 68.3%), Asian (n = 12; 20%), Black (n = 0; 0%), Biracial (n = 4; 6.7%), other (n = 2; 3.3%), and one participant preferred not to answer (1.7%). Approximately 10% (n = 6) of the sample identified as Hispanic. Participants identified as heterosexual (n = 28, 63.3%), bisexual (n = 15, 25%), lesbian, gay, or homosexual (n = 2, 3.3%) and other (n = 5, 8.3%). Procedure Participants were recruited from psychology classes and through posting flyers on campus. Participants completed a brief online screener to determine eligibility for the study. The screener included questions related to history of NSSI, as measured by the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory . Participants received course credit for completing the screener. Those eligible were invited to schedule an in-person session to complete two parts of the study. This research was approved by Temple University's Institutional Review Board. Part 1. At the baseline in-person visit, participants completed an interview to confirm repetitive NSSI history (SITBI;  and the Emotional Stop Signal Task (ESST; . Part 2. At the conclusion of the in-person visit, participants were trained on the EMA procedures and completed a sample EMA prompt during the session to ensure that they understood all terminology employed in the presented questions. Particular attention was paid to ensuring that participants understood the definition of NSSI, as well as NSSI urges. The next day, participants began to receive text messages including a link to a Qualtrics questionnaire. Participants received four questionnaire links per day for a total of 10 days. The first questionnaire of the day was pre-programmed to align with participants' typical waketime and assessed sleep indices; these data were not analyzed in the current study. Participants also completed three identical signalcontingent questionnaires within a 12-h window of their choosing (e. g., 10am-10pm). The timing of alerts for these three signal-contingent questionnaires were randomized, such that participants received one alert within a morning, afternoon, and evening block. Each of these three alerts was randomized such that no two alerts were less than 90 min apart. Participants were instructed to complete the survey as soon as possible after receiving the alert and were informed that they would only receive credit for surveys completed within 30 min of receiving the alert in order to encourage swift responding. Participants received course credit for completing the EMA study protocol. To increase adherence to the EMA protocol, participants were granted the option of an additional course credit or $15 for completion of at least 85% of the surveys during the ten-day period within the allotted 30 min. The signalcontingent questionnaires prompted participants to report on a range of experiences, emotions, and behaviors. In the current study, only the questions pertaining to NA, urgency, and NSSI urge level were analyzed. Each signal-contingent questionnaire took an average of 2.8 min to complete. Inclusive of all signal-contingent alerts (3x daily surveys), participants completed 88.93% of the 30 alerts over the 10-day period (M = 26.68; SD = 3.49; total completed alerts ~ 1600). Participants completed 71.60% (M = 21.48; SD = 5.27) of the 30 randomized signalcontingent surveys within a 30-min period after receiving the alert and 78.67% (M = 23.60; SD = 4.62) within a 60-min period after receiving the alert. Including prompts responded to by participants within 60 min of receiving the alert allowed us to include approximately 90% of the available data (completed signal-contingent survey alerts), and thus, all alerts completed within 60 min (n = 1427 alerts) were included in the current analyses in order to augment power. Measures Screener Lifetime History of NSSI. The Deliberate Self Harm Inventory (DSHI;  assesses the frequency, duration, and forms of NSSI (e.g., cutting, carving, burning, biting, head-banging). The DSHI asks how often the participant has engaged in each of 17 types of NSSI behaviors with the prompt, ""Have you ever intentionally (i.e., on purpose) _______?"" For each of the 17 types of NSSI behaviors endorsed, respondents are asked about age at onset, frequency, recency, years of engagement, and whether the behavior has ever resulted in a hospitalization or required medical treatment. Research has supported the DSHI's internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct, discriminant, and convergent validity in a university-student sample . In-person session Lifetime History of NSSI. The Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI;  is a structured interview that assesses the presence, frequency, and characteristics of a wide range of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors, including NSSI, suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide gestures, and suicide attempts. In the present study, the SITBI measure of lifetime history of NSSI was used to confirm lifetime engagement in repetitive NSSI. This interview has demonstrated strong psychometric properties and has been used in various clinical and non-clinical settings . The SITBI has demonstrated inter-rater reliability (κ = 0.99), construct validity, and test-retest reliability (κ = 0.70) . Response Inhibition to Self-Harm Stimuli. The Emotional Stop-Signal Task (ESST;  paradigm is a measurement of motor impulse control in response to affective stimuli. Stimuli consisted of randomly presented neutral, negative, and positive images from the International Affective Picture System  in addition to a separate category of stimuli depicting various stages of self-cutting. Participants were given two main instructions. First, participants were asked to indicate the valence of each image as positive or negative ""as quickly and accurately as possible"" by pressing corresponding keys on a computer keyboard. Second, participants were informed that a subset of trials include an auditory ""stop-signal"" tone that accompanied some images after a brief, variable delay (50-1150 ms). If the stop-signal was present, participants were directed to refrain from responding to stimulus valence and to not press a key, i.e., to inhibit prepotent motor responses accompanying emotional reactions to the images. Commission errors (""false alarms"") occur when participants fail to inhibit their keyboard response to an image during stop-signal trials. The stop-signal delay begins at 250 ms post-stimulus onset and is dynamically adjusted using a 50 ms staircase tracking procedure, such that the delay is increased by 50 ms following each successful inhibition and conversely decreased by 50 ms after each false alarm. This staircase function is used to ensure that participants achieve a 50% total commission error rate (approximately) across all stimulus categories; if we predicted no differences in emotional response inhibition as a function of image content, we would expect that about half of stop trials would accordingly produce false alarms, regardless of the presented stimulus. Deviations from this 50% commission error rate within each specific stimulus category thus indicate the relative ease or difficulty of inhibiting emotional reactions to the content in that particular type of image (e.g., self-cutting). Akin to prior research (e.g., , in the present study, inhibitory control over emotional reactions to self-harm stimuli was operationalized as the percentage of commission errors made during stop-signal trials with NSSI images relative to the total number of stop-signal trials during which NSSI images were presented, while controlling for the rate of false alarms to neutral stimuli (as an index of general response inhibition). Thus, a higher NSSI commission error rate represents poorer emotional response inhibition specifically to stimuli depicting self-harm. While commission error rates are not traditionally used to index response inhibition, accumulating evidence supports the validity of this approach . Provided that participants achieve an overall commission error rate of approximately 50% across all stimulus categories (which is the goal of the delay algorithm), we should not observe stimulus-specific deviations from this baseline rate unless there are actual differences in the ability to inhibit responses to different types of stimuli. Past work has consistently found image valence effects on ESST false alarm rates across stimulus categories, suggesting an appreciable signal-to-noise ratio for stimulus-specific commission error rates as a metric of within-person differences in emotional response inhibition. Ecological momentary assessment Urgency. In the current study, three items were adapted from the negative urgency subscale of the UPPS-P Impulsivity Scale (UPPS-P; Lynam, Smith,  and included in the EMA signal contingent surveys to examine momentary urgency. The UPPS-P is a 59-item scale that assesses five traits related to impulsive behaviors: negative urgency, positive urgency, lack of perseverance, lack of planning, and sensation seeking. The UPPS-P has demonstrated good internal consistency in prior studies (e.g., . The three items consisted of, ""Right now, I feel like doing something I will later regret in order to make myself feel better now,"" ""Right now, it feels hard to resist acting on my feelings,"" and ""Right now, it feels hard to keep my feelings under control."" Items were rated on a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 9 (very much) with higher scores indicating greater momentary urgency. The mean of the three items generated a total score. In addition to this momentary average, we calculated daily averages within each person and a person average. Reliability estimates indicated excellent reliability for average person urgency ratings across the EMA period (R KF = 0.99), adequate reliability at the day level (R 1R = 0.68) and fair reliability at the occasion level (R 1R = 0.56). Negative Affect. To measure NA, the signal contingent survey asked participants to respond to the prompt, ""Right now, to what extent are you feeling …"" in the context of three NA-related states: ""sad,"" ""lonely,"" and ""hopeless."" Participants rated each item on a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 9 (very much) with higher scores indicating greater levels of NA. The mean of the three items generated a total score. In addition to this momentary average, we additionally calculated daily averages within each person and a person average. Reliability estimates indicated excellent reliability for average person NA ratings across the EMA period (R KF = 0.99), and adequate reliability at the day level (R 1R = 0.74) and at the occasion level (R 1R = 0.63). NSSI Urge. To measure NSSI Urge, the signal contingent survey included the prompt, ""Right now, how intense is your urge to engage in non-suicidal self-injury?"" Participants rated this item on a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 9 (very much), with higher scores indicating greater momentary urge to engage in NSSI. NSSI Behavior. To measure NSSI behavior, the signal contingent survey included the prompt, ""Since the last alert, have you engaged in non-suicidal self-injury?"" Participants responded yes or no. This question was included to provide descriptive statistics about our sample; we were not powered to examine NSSI behavior in this study. Analytic strategy Generalized linear multi-level models (MLM) with restricted maximum likelihood estimation accounted for the nesting of the EMA data (i.e., observations nested within days nested within persons) and uneven spacing of observations across episodes and persons. Models had three levels (occasion, day, and person) and included a random intercept at the person-level. NSSI urge was the criterion, which we treated as a count variable due to the relative sparsity of urge ratings above '1'. We present results from models using a Poisson distribution. Overdispersion can occur with the Poisson distribution and can lead to the inflation of significance estimates. Examination of the ratio of the sum of squared Pearson residuals and the residual degrees of freedom, an estimation of overdispersion, revealed no evidence for overdispersion (range = 0.47 -0.66; . The ratio of observed to predicted number of zeros for NSSI urges was close to 1 (0.96), indicating that NSSI urges was not zero inflated beyond what is appropriate for the Poisson distribution (Lüdecke, Makowski, Waggoner & Patil, 2020). Analyses were performed in R using the glmer function from the package lme4 . Models included 1427 observations over 577 days across 60 participants. The primary predictors of interest were occasion-level NA and urgency (measured at the same occasion as NSSI urge intensity), and person-level emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli. We additionally included in models day-(i.e., the day average of occasionlevel estimates) and person-level (i.e., the person average of day-level estimates) NA and urgency to adjust for these effects. Indicators were centered on the cluster mean at the next level, with person-level estimates centered within the sample mean. This was done to disaggregate effects at these different levels . We conducted main effect models, followed by two sets of interaction models. In the first interaction model, we examined the interaction between occasion-level NA and urgency, and person-level emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli. We then conducted these same models, while adjusting for the effects of person-level emotional response inhibition to neutral stimuli. Emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli and neutral stimuli were sample-centered. Reflecting our primary interest in the occasion-level and for parsimony, we only included in models the interactions for occasion-level NA and urgency with emotional response inhibition to self-harm and neutral stimuli. Results Descriptives The sample reported an average of 57 lifetime NSSI acts (Range: 2-720; SD = 128.47) and 7.7 past-year NSSI acts (Range: 0-180; SD = 26.53). Retrospectively, at baseline, approximately 45% (n = 27) of the sample endorsed engaging in NSSI over the past year, 20% (n = 12) over the past month, and 5% (n = 3) over the past week. Also at baseline, approximately 50% (n = 29) of the sample endorsed experiencing an NSSI urge over the past year, 31.7% (n = 19) over the past month, and 15% (n = 9) over the past week. Participants reported engaging in an average of two NSSI methods over their lifetimes (SD = 1.10). The majority of participants endorsed cutting/carving skin (76.7%; n = 46). Approximately 18.3% reported burning skin (n = 11), 6.7% (n = 4) inserting sharp objects underneath skin/nails, 20% (n = 12) picking areas of the body to the point of drawing blood, 23.3% (n = 14) hitting self, 1.7% (n = 1) giving self a tattoo, and 26.7% (n = 16) other methods. Findings suggested that ESST response inhibition to self-harm stimuli did not differ between participants with versus without a history of NSSI (t(116) = − 0.08, p = .938). Within the NSSI group, the mean ESST response inhibition to self-harm stimuli was 0.56 (SD = 0.20). 1 The nosignal reaction time (i.e., mean reaction time on trials without a stopsignal) was 755.14 ms (SD = 103.97), the stop-signal reaction time (i. e., an index of overall emotional response inhibition) was 289.56 ms (SD = 67.66), the total omission errors across stimulus categories was 4.74 (SD = 4.81), and the total commission errors across stimulus categories was 0.47 (SD = 0.08). Over the EMA period, 41.7% (n = 25) of the sample reported an NSSI urge. Participants reported an NSSI urge on 8.2% of prompts (n = 117). On prompts with an NSSI urge, mean intensity rating of urge was 2.66 (SD = 2.09). Approximately 13.33% (n = 8) of participants reported NSSI behavior on 0.6% of the total prompts (n = 9 reported NSSI acts). Across the EMA period, mean NA was 1.84 (SD = 2.03) and mean urgency was 0.96 (SD = 1.58). Prior to centering, NA and urgency were correlated (r[1425] = 0.622, p < .001). NSSI urge intensity was correlated with both NA (r[1425] = 0.385, p < .001) and urgency (r[1425] = 0.407, p < .001). After centering, occasion-level (r[1425] = 0.227, p < .001), day-level (r[1425] = 0.176, p < .001), and person-level NA and urgency (r[1425] = 0.725, p < .001) continued to be correlated. There was sufficient variance at the level of occasion, day, and person for negative affect (ICCs = 27%, 15%, 58% respectively) and urgency (ICCs = 37%, 17%, 46% respectively), which justified our three-level approach to analysis. Occasion-level negative affect and urgency with NSSI urges In separate models, we examined the association of NA with NSSI urges, and the association of urgency with NSSI urges. Results are presented in Table . Moment-, day-and person-level NA were associated with reporting a stronger NSSI urge when modeled simultaneously. Similarly, moment-, day-, and person-level urgency also were associated with reporting a stronger NSSI urge. Finally, we examined a model that included NA, urgency, and their interaction. There were no changes to main effects, except that person-level NA was no longer significant. The interactions of NA and urgency at occasion-, day-, and person-level all were not significant. Cross-level interactions with emotional response inhibition to selfharm stimuli Prior to examining interactions, we first conducted a model for the main effect of emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli. In this model, emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli was not associated with NSSI urge intensity (Est. = 1.79, 95% CI = [-2.62, 6.20], p = .427). To examine interactions with emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli, we created separate models for NA and urgency. For these models, the interactions of occasion-level NA and urgency, respectively, with emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli were of primary interest, while day-and person-level main effects were included to adjust for their effects. Results are presented in Table . For NA, there was a significant interaction between occasion-level NA and emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli. To understand this interaction, we calculated simple slopes and found that the association of NA and NSSI urge intensity was significant at both 1 SD above (Est. = 0.58, 95% CI = [0.44, 0.71], p < .001) and below (Est. = 0.26, 95% CI = [0.10, 0.41], p = .001) the mean for emotional response inhibition, but was stronger at 1 SD above the mean. This indicates that participants who exhibited greater deficits in emotional response inhibition to self- Note. N = 60 individuals, 1427 observations. CI = confidence interval.

When we conducted the same model, adjusting for person-level response inhibition to neutral stimuli, this interaction remained significant. Results are presented in Table . For urgency, there was a similar interaction between occasion-level urgency and emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli (Table ). We again calculated simple slopes and found that the association of urgency and NSSI urge intensity was significant at both 1 SD above (Est. = 0.46, 95% CI = [0.39, 0.54], p < .001) and below (Est. = 0.32, 95% CI = [0.22, 0.42], p < .001) the mean for emotional response inhibition, but was stronger at 1 SD above the mean. 2 When we conducted the same model, adjusting for person-level response inhibition to neutral stimuli, this interaction was no longer significant (Table ). There were no significant main effects for response inhibition to selfharm nor to neutral stimuli in either model. 3 Discussion The current study found evidence for main effects associations of occasion-level NA and urgency with NSSI urge intensity, providing greater corroboration that elevated NA and the impulsive urge to alter affective experiences are concomitants of NSSI urges . However, contrary to hypotheses, there was no interaction between occasion-level NA and urgency in predicting NSSI urge intensity. Additionally, we did not observe a direct association of emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli with occasion-level NSSI urge intensity. We did, however, find evidence that the degree of impaired emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli impacts the relationship between momentary NA and NSSI urge intensity, even when adjusting for emotional response inhibition to neutral stimuli. Our findings highlight that, among individuals with a history of repetitive NSSI, occasion-level NA is associated with NSSI urge intensity. In line with a large body of literature suggesting that the most prevalent function of NSSI is to reduce aversive affective experiences , we found that occasions, as well as days and people, characterized by higher NA were associated with stronger NSSI urges. We similarly found that occasions, as well as days and people, characterized by higher urgency were associated with stronger NSSI urges. Cross-sectional (e.g.,  and longitudinal  evidence suggests that negative urgency is related to and predictive of NSSI. Our results extend this literature to the natural environment, where individuals experience NSSI urges in their daily lives, and validate prior work suggesting that day-level general impulsivity is associated with NSSI acts . To our knowledge, this is the first EMA study examining the relationship between occasion-level urgency and NSSI urge intensity. Our hypothesis that the greatest NSSI urges would be expected at high levels of both NA and urgency was not supported. Rather, our findings suggest that self-reported occasion-level NA and urgency may be conceptualized best as having independent associations with NSSI urge intensity. Our preliminary analyses suggest that emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli did not differ between participants with and without a history of repetitive NSSI. In line with this null finding, we did not find evidence supporting a main effect association of emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli with the momentary strength of the NSSI urges. However, our results demonstrate that performance on this task independently moderated associations between occasion-level NA and the intensity of NSSI urges. Specifically, our findings suggest that emotional response inhibition deficits to self-harm stimuli may pose vulnerability for increased NSSI urge intensity during real-time states of elevated NA. Given that this association remained after adjusting for response inhibition to neutral stimuli, our results offer evidence that this association is specific to response inhibition to self-harm stimuli. It is possible that individuals with this deficit might have difficulty inhibiting their self-injury urge impulses in the context of negative affective risk states, thus facilitating stronger urges. The results complement previous daily diary work that found that greater baseline self-report negative urgency strengthened the association between daily sadness and NSSI urges . Our findings and those of  together indicate that trait-level negative urgency may augment the association between occasion-level negative emotions and NSSI urge intensity. The present findings support the theory that skills training to develop alternative ways of regulating aversive affect and affect-driven states such as urgency, may be an effective clinical approach for reducing NSSI Note. N = 60 individuals, 1427 observations. CI = confidence interval. ESST = Emotional Stop-Signal Task, RI = Response Inhibition. Results presented are from Poisson models. 2 As described in the analytic strategy, models used a Poisson distribution, which we believe to be the most appropriate model to run, due to the absence of evidence for overdispersion. However, we also conducted models using normal, negative binomial, and zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) distributions. Results from models using a normal distribution did not differ from models using a Poisson distribution. For the negative binomial models, the interactions for ESST response inhibition and negative affect (Est. = 0.74, 95% CI = − 0.21, 1.69, p = .126) and urgency (Est. = 0.53, 95% CI = − 0.14, 1.19, p = .119) were not significant, though the estimates were of similar magnitude and in the same direction as those reported in Table . This, however, is not particularly surprising as the difference between Poisson and negative binomial models is that the latter include a parameter to account for overdispersion. In the absence of overdispersion, this could lead to an overestimation of the variance in NSSI Urges, resulting in incorrectly higher standard errors and decreased significance. For the ZIP models, similar to negative binomial models, the interactions for ESST response inhibition and negative affect (Est. = 0.56, 95% CI = − 0.07, 1.18, p = .082) and urgency (Est. = 0.30, 95% CI = − 0.20, 0.81, p = .235) were not significant, though the estimates were of similar magnitude and in the same direction. However, the zero-inflation portion was not significant and there was no evidence of zero inflation of NSSI urges, indicating that the Poisson distribution is more appropriate. urges and therefore NSSI behaviors. Dialectical Behavior Therapy  emotion regulation and distress tolerance skills may be particularly relevant skills. Our findings indicate that these types of interventions may be especially effective for individuals who present with deficits in cognitive control, specifically related to difficulties regulating negative emotional reactions and behavioral responses to negative emotions in the presence of NSSI-related stimuli. Limitations It is essential to consider study limitations when interpreting the findings. First, although a strength of the current study was its focus on the clinically relevant but understudied topic of NSSI urges, it was not designed to assess predictors of NSSI acts. Urges are more frequent, facilitating the assessment of their strength in the moment, repeatedly across time. Additionally, it is arguable that urges are less constrained by situation or context. In contrast, individuals may only be able to engage in NSSI under somewhat more restricted circumstances (e.g., at home, when alone; . As a result, examining urges allowed us to examine more fully the proximal roles of NA and urgency in NSSI maintenance. Nevertheless, the generalizability of findings to engagement in NSSI is unclear and warrants investigation in future work. Indeed, it has been postulated within the craving literature that urges may occur only under circumstances when engagement in a behavior is thwarted, and further, that urges may not be necessary for behavior engagement . Such assertions may point to an important distinction between the psychological state of experiencing an urge to engage in NSSI versus actually engaging in NSSI. Further, examining whether these findings are generalizable is essential, as poor response inhibition may very well have a stronger relationship with action (engagement in NSSI) than urges, particularly in the context of negative affect and urgency. Second, the number of reported NSSI urges was also relatively low (41.7% of participants; 8.2% of prompts; n = 117), but comparable to previous EMA examinations of NSSI urges in undergraduates (e.g., . Third, participants only completed three assessments per day. This precluded us from examining lagged effects over time within days, as such analyses would be limited to only two assessments per day, greatly reducing power which would have limited our ability to carry out the cross-level interaction analyses. We strongly encourage future research to examine these within-day lagged effects in order to shed light on the directionality of the proposed relations. Fourth, the majority of the sample was female, and it is unknown whether findings generalize to males, as well as to non-college samples. Fifth, the present findings' interpretability is somewhat constrained by the design of the ESST version we used in this study. For example, this ESST uses a single staircase tracking algorithm to adjust stop-signal delay. This design feature allows us to efficiently capture varying capacities for emotional response inhibition within individuals as a function of image content (by examining patterns of commission errors across stimulus categories) but precludes estimation of stimulus-specific stopsignal reaction time, the most commonly derived metric of response inhibition in this type of task. Finally, we were likely underpowered to detect cross-level interactions (i.e., interactions of occasion-level variables and emotional response inhibition). Interactions that include predictors at the person-level require significant numbers of participants to have power to detect medium to small effect sizes in two-level models . However, this power-related limitation does not apply to effects that were solely at the occasion-level. Future investigations employing larger sample sizes and with samples with a more recent and severe history of NSSI are warranted in order to examine whether the present cross-level effect will replicate, and extend, to NSSI behavior. Conclusion The present study builds on limited prior EMA research examining the association between NA and NSSI urge intensity in that it is the first EMA study to examine the relationship between occasion-level urgency and NSSI. Our findings present initial evidence that between-person emotional response inhibition deficits to self-harm stimuli may increase the strength of NSSI urges within person, during real-time heightened NA. Importantly, the broader field of clinical science has yet to regularly incorporate objective metrics derived from behavioral tasks into EMA studies of psychopathology , particularly to examine the interplay of trait-level factors with state (i.e., occasion-level) affect. This is the first study to our knowledge to examine a theoretically relevant between-person behavioral measure of cognitive control as a moderator of a hypothesized state-level precipitant of NSSI urges, thus offering a unique contribution.

12,12,How adolescents' working memory abilities relate to their alcohol craving in real-life contexts depends on biological sex,"We sought to elucidate whether stress, peers, and in vivo (i.e., direct) alcohol cues elicit alcohol craving in daily life among adolescents and to test whether individual variation in working memory function and biological sex alters these associations. Methods: We leveraged ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine momentary associations between stress, peers, and direct alcohol cues with craving, assessed as ""urge to drink alcohol,"" among 86 male (51.2 %) and female (48.8 %) frequent drinkers (i.e., two or more drinking days per week). Participants were ages 14-24 years (M = 20.7 years, SD = 2.1). Participants completed EMA throughout the day for about one week prior to randomization to a treatment condition for an AUD clinical trial. Pre-registered, secondary analyses focused on craving for assessments when adolescents were not drinking, and assessments occurring after drinking on drinking days were removed. Working memory performance was assessed in the laboratory via the Memory for Words subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Cognitive Abilities. Results: Craving was heightened at more stressful moments and when adolescents were with their peers and in the presence of direct alcohol cues. Working memory function was not related to craving but altered the relation of momentary stress, peers, and cues with craving once biological sex-related differences were considered. Females generally had lower craving than males, but working memory function served to buffer against stressinduced craving for males. Conclusions: Higher working memory function buffered the in-the-moment relation of stress with alcohol craving for males but not females.","[""Stress"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Alcohol"", ""Adolescents"", ""Craving""]",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108642,"Introduction Vulnerability to alcohol use disorder (AUD) is greater for adolescents who drink heavily, potentially via neural adaptations promoting susceptibility to stress and cue-induced alcohol craving . The relevance of craving, defined as the subjective experience of wanting alcohol or drugs , is underscored by its role as a diagnostic criterion for substance use disorder , primacy as a target for pharmacological and behavioral treatments , and longstanding centrality to addiction theory and research . A recent systematic review of 18 theoretical frameworks identified stress as an essential parameter for examining craving in real-world settings and working memory (WM) as a potentially supported parameter . Alcohol craving in response to in vivo (i.e., direct) alcohol cues appears to be an important factor contributing to adolescent alcohol misuse and the development of AUD . Less research focuses on adolescents' craving in other situations, such as when around their peers  or under conditions of stress . The present study assesses adolescent's alcohol craving in real life situations including when in the presence of direct alcohol cues, when around peers, and at times of heightened stress. Potential moderating influences of individual differences in WM and biological sex are examined. Adolescence is well-defined by social, behavioral, and cognitive changes that extend into the mid-twenties . Among these changes are proneness to stress response and increased substance-taking behavior, which is reflected in the rapid escalation of problem drinking patterns . For over a century, theorists and researchers have sought to understand this period of ""storm and stress"" that is adolescence . It is now generally agreed that while adolescents, on average, are more emotionally volatile and reckless than children or adults, there are important individual differences among adolescents that buffer against these tendencies . Deficient WM, a core facet of neurocognitive function, is associated with stress reactivity and implicated in leading models of addiction as an individual difference that may promote substance misuse . If stress and drinking are, as suggested, ""a toxic combination for the teenage brain"" , then understanding how WM deficits may exacerbate the link between stress and alcohol craving is a high priority. Associations of stress, WM, and alcohol craving may differ for adolescent males and females. There is extensive evidence for behavioral differences in risk trajectories for alcohol misuse among adolescent males and females, and the emotional brain circuitry involved in stress processing may be a mechanism contributing to differences . Research suggests that WM may develop earlier in females but is also more susceptible to alcohol-related damage . At the same time, alcohol-cued craving is heightened with escalating drinking patterns and more so for males than females . In a prospective study of neural markers of alcohol cue reactivity, males developed greater cue reactivity after drinking onset than females, even when both males and females were drinking at the same moderate-to-heavy rate . Adolescent males who drink heavily also show greater frontal brain activation during a WM task than same-sex controls, where females who drink heavily showed less activation . Other work shows that the frontal and limbic processing regions of adolescent female brains may be more reactive to negative emotional stimuli than those of their male counterparts . Given that sex-related differences in drinking patterns and problems emerge during the transition from early to late adolescence, understanding differential vulnerabilities to alcohol misuse among adolescent male and female problem drinkers is of paramount importance . The present secondary analysis seeks to elucidate whether adolescents with diminished capacity for cognitive control, as demonstrated by poor performance on a laboratory task assessing WM, may be especially prone to exhibit alcohol craving under certain conditions in daily life. Current advances in ecological momentary assessment (EMA) technology allow for real-time monitoring of craving in natural environments via smartphones . We hypothesize that stress will be positively associated with alcohol craving (assessed as ""urge to drink alcohol"") reported on smartphones in adolescents' daily lives, after accounting for other contextual influences (i.e., time of day, day of week), and this association will be more pronounced among youth with lower WM performance. Our hypotheses are pre-registered here: osf.io/c3n6s. Given biological sex-related differences in WM development and neural effects of alcohol , we also explore whether WM deficits operate uniquely for adolescent males and females. Materials and methods Participants Participants were 14-to 24-year-old adolescents (n = 86) recruited from the community for a clinical trial testing the efficacy of a medication to reduce alcohol consumption (NCT01641445). The age criterion capitalized on the peak developmental window for AUD  and allowed the parent trial to test the efficacy of a medication to treat AUD in adolescents. All data reported herein were from an initial EMA monitoring period lasting approximately 1 week and occurring prior to randomization for the parent trial. To be eligible for the parent trial, adolescents were required to drink alcohol at least two days per week in the past 30 days and read English. Because the parent trial tested a medication, females were excluded if they were pregnant, nursing, or unwilling to use a reliable method of birth control. Other exclusions included receiving alcohol treatment in the past 30 days, seeking formal alcohol treatment, and living with someone who was actively participating in the study. Active psychotic symptoms and suicidality were also exclusionary. The Brown University Institutional Review Board approved all study procedures. Procedures Interested volunteers completed a telephone screening; those who appeared eligible were scheduled for an in-person screening. Consent was obtained from those 18 years of age and older; parent permission and minor assent were obtained for those younger than 18 years. At the initial study visit, self-report and interview assessments were administered and the EMA protocol was explained to participants. EMA training included a ""demo"" feature that allowed participants to practice completing different report types with the help of study staff. Participants were provided with Samsung smartphones operating custom EMA software. All other phone features were disabled. Aspects of our protocol were designed to maximize EMA compliance, including the ability to suspend device-initiated prompts for up to 7 h to accommodate times when responding was restricted or unsafe (e.g., at sports practice, driving a car), an alarm function that suspended prompts while participants were sleeping and delivered an audible alarm in the morning at the participant's chosen waking time, and a delay feature. To approximate a true ""momentary"" assessment of focal variables, however, responses could only be delayed twice, for 10 min as a time, resulting in a maximum delay of 20 min. Once a device-initiated prompt was delivered, participants had 2 min to either initiate or delay the assessment before it was marked as missed. The number of missed prompts each day was displayed on the main menu of the smartphone screen in bold, red text. Participants were compensated up to $5 per day for completing assessments. Compliance was tracked with a custom web application and checked by research staff near daily. A combination of smartphone-and user-initiated prompts captured momentary feelings (e.g., stress, craving), situations (e.g., location, social context), and specific events (e.g., alcohol consumption). Smartphone-initiated audible prompts occurred throughout the day and notified participants to complete reports. These reports were delivered once randomly in each 3 -h block and are referred to herein as ""random assessments."" Random assessments did not overlap with ""sleep"" mode or drinking episodes. Additionally, upon waking participants completed a morning report that assessed alcohol use the prior day (e.g., total standard drinks consumed). Participants were also instructed to self-initiate a drink report before and after each standard drink they consumed. Participants were trained to discern standard drinks using a graphic manual depicting common beverages and volumes. To simplify the instructional set, participants were instructed to self-initiate drink reports for every drink consumed, but the assessment battery only captured the first three standard drinks of a drinking episode. Person-level measures Demographic and clinical characteristics Participants were asked to report demographic characteristics, including biological sex (male = 0; female = 1) and age. AUD symptom count was determined with the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders for School-Age Children, a semi-structured interview based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria . Interviewers received systematic training and achieved a high level of inter-rater reliability (kappa > 0.90). A symptom count combining abuse and dependence criteria provided a unidimensional measure of AUD symptomatology. The maximum possible AUD symptom count was 11. Alcohol use Assessment of alcohol use prior to the study determined eligibilitly and described the participants' typical drinking patterns. A Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) interview  assessed the total number of standard drinks per day in the 90 days prior to this study. Percent drinking days and drinks per drinking day were calculated to describe drinking frequency and quantity, respecitvely. Working memory performance The Memory for Words subtest of the Woodcock Johnson®-III Tests of Cognitive Abilities  captured WM performance. WM most commonly describes processes involved in holding and manipulating information in immediate awareness for a short period of time. In the Memory for Words subtest, an examiner reads a list of sentences, and the examinee is asked to repeat the list of sentences in the same order as presented. According to the dominant Baddeley model of WM , the Memory for Words subtest measures storage and rehearsal components of the phonological loop, which is the most empirically supported of the WM components in this theoretical model . Trained staff administered the test in accordance with standard administration instructions. Testing occurred in the afternoon whenever possible to control for any possible effects of diurnal variation on neuropsychological test performance, and all participants reported abstinence from drugs and alcohol on the day of testing, and a breathalyzer test indicated 0.00 g/210 l breath alcohol content. Momentary measures 2.4.1. Alcohol craving Momentary craving was assessed with a single-item measure of ""urge to drink"" on an 11-point visual analog scale from ""no urge"" (0) to ""strongest ever"" (10). In EMA training, participants received a graphic manual with sample EMA items and a glossary of terms that defined ""urge"" as ""how much you crave, want, or desire something like alcohol, pot, or a cigarette."" Stress Momentary stress was assessed with two items asking participants to rate how ""stressed"" or ""tense"" they were on 11-point visual analogue scales from ""not at all"" (0) to ""extremely"" (10). A composite (average) of the two ratings indicated momentary stress (α = .84). Each person's average of their momentary stress ratings over the duration of the EMA period quantified their general stress level, referred to herein as ""average stress."" Alcohol cues Participants had options to identify whether alcohol cues were not present, indirectly present (e.g., on TV, in a magazine), or directly present (e.g., bottle or glass in real life) at random assessments. Only direct cues were considered to indicate the presence of alcohol cues (1). Each person's average of 0's (alcohol cues not directly present) and 1's (alcohol cues directly present) over the duration of the EMA period quantified the proportion of time they spent in the presence of direct alcohol cues, referred to herein as ""average alcohol cues."" Contextual variables Date and time stamps recorded for each EMA entry were used to identify contextual covariates relating to diurnal and weekly patterns. Weekend status was defined as 6 p.m. on Friday through 6 p.m. on Sunday and dichotomized into weekend (1) or weekday (0). Time of day was represented by four, 6-hr blocks starting from midnight (6 a.m. to noon = reference category, 0). Analytic plan Multilevel modeling (MLM) with an unstructured variance-covariance matrix and between-within degrees of freedom accounted for the nesting of random assessments (Level 1) within persons (Level 2). Reports occurring while or after drinking on a given day were excluded to avoid confounding the effects of drinking with craving. Level 1 predictors included momentary stress, momentary presence of environmental alcohol cues (i.e., presence of direct alcohol cues), time of day, and weekend status. Momentary stress and cues were centered at the person mean to disaggregate momentary fluctuations from person-level processes. Level 2 variables were age, sex (dichotomous, males as reference), person-level stress (i.e., the person average of momentary stress reports), person-level alcohol cues (i.e., the person average of momentary alcohol-cue reports), WM, and AUD symptom count. All continuous Level 2 variables were grand-mean centered. Models included random intercepts. Initial models tested whether craving was associated with greater likelihood of drinking, accounting for covariates. These utilized a binary response distribution (0 = non-drinking day; 1 = drinking day) with a logit link, maximum likelihood estimation, Laplace approximation, and between-within degrees of freedom. Predicted probability of drinking was calculated from the odds, i.e., exponentiated sum of product estimates, as follows: odds ÷ (1 + odds). Focal models utilized a normal distribution with an unstructured covariance matrix, restricted maximum likelihood estimation, and between-within degrees of freedom. First, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was estimated from an intercept-only model to identify the relative variability in craving due to person vs. momentary influences. Next, cross-level interactive effects of WM × Momentary Stress, Cues, and Peers tested the primary hypotheses, accounting for covariates. Last, analyses tested whether interactive effects were dependent on the participant's sex through including three-way interactive effects of Sex × WM × Stress, Cues, and Peers. In the case of a significant three-way interactive effect, these were probed through subsequent models testing interactive effects for WM × Stress, Cues, and Peers separately for males and females. Interactive effects were illustrated graphically through plotting simple slopes . Results Person-level descriptive statistics ""Person-level"" refers to processes that account for individual differences between participants. Person-level variables are either measured only once (e.g., age, sex) or are averaged across time (e.g., person-level stress). In focal analyses, grand-mean centering was used to facilitate interpretation of the intercept and fixed-effect parameters. Descriptive statistics here refer to person-level variables in their original form (not centered). On average, participants were 20.7 years old (SD = 2.1), and about half (48.8 %) indicated female biological sex. The majority identified as White (73.3 %), Black (14.0 %), Asian (4.7 %) or American Indian (3.5 %); 20.9 % indicated Hispanic ethnicity. Participants reported drinking, on average, 4.9 standard drinks per drinking day in the past month (SD = 3.1) and reported alcohol consumption on 37.6 % of days (SD = 20.0). The number of AUD symptoms ranged from 0 to 9 (M = 3.4; SD = 2.1). The average Memory for Words number correct was 18.9 (SD = 1.9; min = 15; max = 24). Average stress was 3.0 (SD = 2.0), and average craving was 1.9 (SD = 1.8). On average, participants indicated direct alcohol cues were present for 19 % of random assessments completed (M = 0.19, SD = 0.24), and peers were present for 31 % of random assessments completed (M = 0.31, SD = 0.24). Person-level and momentary craving variability ""Momentary"" refers to processes that account for a participant's fluctuations in focal variables. Momentary variables are repeated measures over time (e.g., momentary stress, momentary presence of alcohol). In focal analyses, person-mean centering was used to disaggregate momentary effects from person-level effects. An initial, intercept-only mixed model explored the variability in craving due to person-level and momentary factors. The ICC was 0.42, indicating that 42 % of the variability in craving was due to person-level influences. The remaining 58 % of the variability in craving was due to momentary influences, which includes error variance. Relation of craving with drinking Momentary craving predicted greater likelihood of drinking that day, b = 0.09, SE = 0.04, OR = 1.09, p = .018, accounting for all covariates including the effect of person-level craving. In terms of predicted probability, when momentary craving was not endorsed, the percent chance of drinking that day was 10.1 %. In contrast, when momentary craving was rated at the sample average, the percent chance of drinking that day was 19.6 %, and when momentary craving was endorsed as ""strongest ever"" the percent chance of drinking that day was 35.1 %. Person-level craving, aggregated across all timepoints, was marginally associated with greater likelihood of drinking, on average, b = 0.18, SE = 0.10, OR = 1.20, p = .080, accounting for all covariates including the effect of momentary craving. Relation of stress with craving Greater momentary stress was associated with heightened momentary craving, b = 0.16, SE = 0.03, p < .001, accounting for all covariates including the effect of person-level stress (Table ). Likewise, greater person-level stress was associated with heighted craving, on average, b = 0.24, SE = 0.10, p = .022, accounting for all covariates including the effect of momentary stress. Being in the presence of peers at that moment was also associated with heightened momentary craving, b = 0.37, SE = 0.13, p = .003, where spending more time with peers, aggregated across all timepoints, was not related to craving, on average, p = .910. Being in the presence of alcohol at that moment was also associated with heightened momentary craving, b = 0.78, SE = 0.16, p < .001, where spending more time in the presence of alcohol, aggregated across all timepoints, was not related to craving, on average, p = .850. With regard to other person-level covariates, AUD symptom count and WM were not related to craving, ps = .220 and .196, respectively, where female sex was associated with lower craving, on average, b = − 1.00, SE = 0.40, p = .014. Moderation by working memory and sex On the whole, WM did not moderate the relation of momentary stress with craving, p = .738 (Table ). Likewise, WM did not moderate the relation of momentary presence of peers or presence of direct alcohol cues with craving, ps = .947 and .972, respectively. Sex-differences analyses suggested, however, that the putative interaction of WM and stress on craving differed by biological sex, b = 0.09, SE = 0.03, p = .002. The three-way interactive effect was probed through examining interactive effects of WM and momentary stress separately for males and females. For males, WM buffered the association of momentary stress with craving, b = − 0.06, SE = 0.02, p = .008. For females, however, the relation of momentary stress and craving was not significant and in the opposite direction, b = 0.03, SE = 0.02, p = .138. The interactive effect is illustrated graphically in Fig.  through plotting simple slopes for each biological sex at +/− 1 standard deviation WM. Additional specificity Note.

Including interactive effects of working memory with person-level peers, alcohol cues, and stress did not alter the significance of focal parameter estimates. analyses with other person-level moderators, i.e., AUD symptoms and age, were not significant. Sex differences were also present with regard to WM moderating the momentary influences of being in the presence of peers and direct alcohol cues on craving (peers: b = − 0.45, SE = 0.13, p < .001; alcohol cues: b = 0.44, SE = 0.15, p = .004). For males, being in the presence of peers or direct alcohol cues was not related to craving, ps = .138 and .074, respectively, which contrasted results for momentary stress. For females, WM buffered the relation of being in the presence of peers with craving, b = − 0.32, SE = 0.12, p = .001, but exacerbated the relation of being in the presence of direct alcohol cues with craving, b = 0.29, SE = 0.12, p = .014, which contrasted results for momentary stress (Table ). Discussion Alcohol's ability to relieve stress or tension is implicated in the most enduring etiological models of AUD development . The neurodevelopmental underpinnings of addiction suggest that neurocognitive deficits, as indicated by poor performance on tests of WM, may exacerbate alcohol misuse during adolescence, promoting AUD in adulthood . The present work examined direct alcohol cues, peers, and stress as predictors of alcohol craving in adolescents' daily lives, and, moreover, how these associations were modified by WM abilities. Adolescents were enrolled in a clinical trial for AUD treatment, and our analyses utilizing a baseline period prior to randomization to treatment condition. Contrary to hypotheses, WM did not alter the relation of momentary stress with craving for the sample as a whole. Instead, results suggested the influence of WM on stress-craving relations may be sex-linked. For males, having higher WM functioning buffered the in-the-moment relation of stress with alcohol craving. Fig. . Simple slopes of craving (y axis) from times of low momentary stress to high momentary stress (x axis), plotted separately by biological sex and at high and low levels of working memory (WM). Black lines correspond to males, and gray lines correspond to females. Dashed lines correspond to +1 standard deviation working memory, and solid lines correspond to -1 standard deviation working memory. Momentary stress is a repeated measure over time and was person-mean centered to reflect a participant's fluctuations in stress relative to their own average. Low and high values on the x axis correspond to +/-1 standard deviation for person-mean centered momentary stress. Note. Est. = unstandardized estimate; LCL = lower confidence limit; UCL = upper confidence limit. Continuous momentary variables are centered at the person mean. Continuous person-level variables are centered at the grand mean. Categorical covariates are not centered, with reference groups specified. This model included all covariates listed in Table . Including random slopes for momentary peers, alcohol cues, and stress reduced the significance of fixed-effect estimates for three-way interactive effects but did not alter the general directional pattern. Including interactive effects of sex and working memory with person-level peers, alcohol cues, and stress did not alter the significance of focal parameter estimates. Females generally had lower craving than males, and the effect of stress on craving was not altered by WM function. Although preliminary, the protective effect of WM function for males appeared to be specific to momentary stress. While sex differences emerged for the interactive effects of WM with direct alcohol cues and with the presence of peers, results were specific to females rather than males. WM function served to protect against craving when females were with their peers and was associated with greater craving when females were in the presence of direct alcohol cues. Findings highlight the importance of considering biological sex when evaluating proneness to alcohol craving under the conditions of stress and when in the presence of peers and direct alcohol cues in daily life. Sex-related differences in prevalence rates for alcohol use and related problems emerge during later adolescence, and understanding factors underlying differences in drinking patterns may help to understand why more adult men develop AUD than adult women . Our work has important limitations. We report secondary analyses; although hypotheses were pre-registered, this study was not designed to address our specific research question. Our study applies intensive data collection in adolescents' daily lives for a brief period, but it does not evaluate change over a longer period, such as months or years. The development of alcohol addiction is characterized by neurocognitive changes to the brain's stress and reward systems leading to increased alcohol-seeking and craving . Pre-existing neurocognitive abnormalities also increase risk for the heavier patterns of alcohol misuse, which, in turn, contribute to widespread alcohol-related deficits . Only longitudinal research over time can distinguish whether sex-linked differences pre-date heavier drinking patterns, are a product of heavier drinking patterns, or both. Additionally, there is no single accepted measure or definition of craving , and our EMA battery included a single item assessing ""urge to drink."" Our measurement of WM is also a limitation. In our study, WM is measured as a static trait, rather than a dynamic state influenced by context. In prior research, WM load compromises decision making, amplifying facilitating effects of social contexts and reducing the inhibitory effects of disincentives . EMA applications typically lay emphasis on the importance of contextual factors, and, as such, it is a limitation that a dynamic measure of WM was not used in addition to the gold-standard laboratory measure. These limitations considered, our work adds to the literature utilizing technological advances to monitor nuanced associations of individual differences and contextual influences on adolescents' alcohol-related behaviors, and, moreover, emphasizes the importance of evaluating differential associations for adolescent males and females. Specifically, our findings suggest that sex-related differences in alcohol problems emerging in later adolescence could be influenced by the interplay of WM and in-the-moment contextual factors. "
13,13,How Task-Unrelated and Freely Moving Thought Relate to Affect: Evidence for Dissociable Patterns in Everyday Life,"Much of our knowledge about the correlates of mind-wandering comes from assessing task-unrelated thought. Less is known about the correlates of freely moving thought, a dimension that assesses the degree to which thoughts arise and unfold with low levels of guidance or constraints. Task-unrelated thought is consistently associated with more negative affective valence compared with being on task; however, it is unclear whether freely moving thought shares the same relationship with affect. We conducted two ecological momentary assessment studies in the context of everyday life and found that the two dimensions have different affective correlates. In Study 1, task-unrelated thought was associated with less positive concurrent valence than being on-task. However, freely moving thought was associated with more positive concurrent valence and was predictive of more positive valence at a subsequent timepoint. Freely moving thought, but not task-unrelated thought, also positively predicted concurrent arousal. Computational sentiment analyses of participants' thought descriptions offered convergent evidence of differential relationships between the two thought dimensions and affect. Study 2 used different measurement scales to assess whether (a) the pattern of findings replicated and (b) if the effects were robust to changes in measurement. The main findings were replicated: task-unrelated thought was negatively associated with concurrent valence, whereas freely moving thought was positively associated with concurrent valence. However, freely moving thought did not predict subsequent valence and was not related to concurrent arousal. The most robust findings related to concurrent valence. Although mindwandering has acquired a relatively negative reputation to date, our findings suggest that there might be positive aspects that remain unexplored.","[""mind-wandering"", ""affect"", ""task-unrelated thought"", ""freely moving thought"", ""valence""]",10.1037/emo0000849,"The study of mind-wandering has grown considerably in recent years-a growth that is matched by an increasing recognition of its cognitive, affective, and clinical relevance. To date, an overwhelming majority of the work in this area (approximately 95% of published results) has conceptualized mindwandering as task-unrelated thought, or when thoughts shift away from one's current task . Taskunrelated thought indeed occurs with remarkable frequency in our waking lives-an estimated 30% to 50% of the time ; but see  and has been related to critical aspects of our everyday lives including cognitive performance , affective states , clinical alterations in thought , and educational outcomes . Although task-unrelated thought has been a primary focus of empirical investigations until now, investigations into the freely moving thought dimension have recently begun as well .  Freely moving thought occurs when thoughts move from one thing to another with relatively low guidance or constraints . Similar to task-unrelated thought, freely moving thought occurs in over 30% of waking thoughts . However, task-unrelated and freely moving thoughts are only weakly related , indicating that they might represent different dimensions of thought. But do task-unrelated thought and freely moving thought have dissociable functional correlates and consequences in everyday life? This question has remained unexamined so far. One of the most stable and widely replicated correlates of task-unrelated thought to date is its negative relationship with concurrent affective valence: off-task thoughts are generally less positive than on-task thoughts . Taskunrelated thought has also been claimed to lead to more negative subjective valence in the future . Recent multidimensional experience sampling studies have since drawn attention to the idea that relationship between task-unrelated thought and affect might often be driven by thought content . For example, task-unrelated thought might only be related to negative affect in certain situations, such as when thinking about the past or sad content . Task-unrelated thought might even lead to more positive affect in some situations, as when the content of thought is interesting  or pleasant . Regardless of content, however, task-unrelated thought is still frequently related to less positive ratings of valence compared with on-task thought in the literature. One possible explanation for this is that task-unrelated thought might be a failure of the executive-control system to inhibit interfering thoughts ; such thoughts might therefore be subjectively appraised as more negative because of the attentional failure itself. In addition, the content of the task-unrelated thought might involve more negative or neutral content, such as current concerns that are unrelated to the current task . Although task focus and other aspects of thought content are undoubtedly important, dynamic dimensions of thought might reveal additional clues behind the relationship between mindwandering and affect. Ottaviani and colleagues , for example, have shown that perseverative thinking (i.e., as when ruminating or worrying) is an inflexible form of thinking with negative affective consequences. Perseverative thinking is thought to be influenced by ""automatic"" or habitual neurocognitive sources that guide one's thoughts toward particularly salient topics, outside of one's deliberate control . People might also ""deliberately"" direct their thoughts toward particular topics, stabilizing attention over time, as when engaging in goaldirected cognition . In contrast to these automatic and deliberate styles of thinking, freely moving thoughts are thought to 'move' with little constraints from one thought to the next, irrespective of their specific content . Notably, a key theoretical difference between task-unrelated and freely moving dimensions is that task-unrelated thought is focused on momentary content, whereas freely moving thought is focused on the dynamics of the thought stream. Elucidating the affective correlates of this freely moving dimension of thought marks a key objective of the present article. Given that freely moving thought is likely to encompass an increased range of mental states, an open question is whether freely moving thought might share a positive relationship with affective valence. This idea is based on  broaden-and-build theory where positive affect is associated with an increased attentional scope and cognitive broadening. Support for this theory comes from multiple studies reporting that positive affect is related to an increased scope of attention across multiple cognitive domains-including visual selective attention , semantic search (remote associates task; , thought-action repertoires , divergent thinking , as well as increased association memory . The broaden-and-build perspective might therefore predict that positive affect would be likely to occur in combination with less constrained, or freely moving, thought that encompasses a broader topic space and more flexible movement between mental states. Based on this idea, we predict that freely moving thought will share a positive relationship with affective valence compared with the negative relationship often observed for task-unrelated thought. Notably, this prediction diverges from the typical negative reputation mind-wandering has accrued over time based on its relationships with valence and performance, captured through scientific titles such as, ""A wandering mind is an unhappy mind"" . This reputation, however, was amassed through the study of task-unrelated thought, and it is therefore possible that other dimensions, such as the freely moving dimension, will have dissociable relationships with affect. Here we use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to test whether different dimensions of mind-wandering have beneficial correlates in daily life. In addition to our main a priori predictions about the valence of one's affective state, we included a second dimension of affectsubjective experiences of arousal-as an exploratory line of research. Common theories of affect highlight two key orthogonal dimensions that describe affective states : valence (unpleasant to pleasant) and arousal (calm/ relaxed to active/energetic). To date, however, previous research has dominantly focused on subjective feelings of valence using a unidimensional scale . A few notable exceptions point to the idea that physiological arousal (measured via pupillometry) might be related to task-unrelated thought. Yet the direction of the relationship has been inconsistent in the literature , leading some researchers to suggest that that the relationship might depend on why a person goes off-task in the first place. For example, the relationship might, in part, be dependent on the task: taskunrelated thought is associated with lower physiological arousal when completing externally demanding tasks, but this relationship is not observed in tasks that demand internally oriented attention . Whereas the aforementioned studies focused on physiological arousal through pupillometry measures, here we take an exploratory look at the relationships between subjective ratings of arousal and task-unrelated thought and freely moving thought. Study 1 Method All research practices described here were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of New Hampshire. Participants In total, 79 undergraduate students (78% female; M age ϭ 19.3, SD age ϭ 1.26) at the University of New Hampshire participated for course credit. Sample size estimates were calculated a priori based on consistent differences in average valence ratings for on versus off-task thought. G ‫ء‬ Power was used to determine that 71 participants were needed to detect an effect size of .3 with .80 power and alpha set to .05 . In order to account for attrition rates, we attempted to collect data from 85 participants. However, six people did not show up for the training session. Anonymized data is available upon request and approval from the original IRB. Key Variables Below we describe the key constructs measured in our study. Task-Unrelated Thought. In Study 1, we adopted the same dichotomous probing strategy as two previous studies comparing task-unrelated thought and affect in everyday life . In this method, task-unrelated thought is considered to be thinking about anything other than what you are currently doing and is measured using a Yes or No response. We initially chose to mimic this probing strategy in order to make more direct comparisons with previous findings related to task-unrelated thought and affect (but see Study 2 for a change in probing strategy). Freely Moving Thought. We adopted the same approach as two of our previous studies assessing freely moving thought in everyday life . Freely moving thought was defined as thoughts that have relatively low guidance or constraints and was measured on a 6-point scale. Affect. Previous research examining task-unrelated thought has predominantly focused on subjective valence using a unidimensional scale . Here we adopt the circumplex model of affect , which posed that affective states can be explained by two orthogonal dimensions: valence (unpleasant to pleasant) and arousal (calm/relaxed to active/energetic). We expand on previous studies by examining these two dimensions of affect simultaneously, rather than solely measuring the valence dimension of affect. Both valence and arousal were measured on scales ranging from 1 to 9, as is common practice in the literature. Materials and Training An open-source application (https://github.com/AndrewRPorter/ ping-app), freely available on GitHub, was built for the purposes of this study to allow us to send and receive thought probes via text messages. Text messages were sent directly to participants' cell phones. The study began with a 35-min training session. Groups of participants (10 to 20 at a time) met in a classroom to give informed consent and receive detailed instructions regarding the task. All training sessions were conducted by the first author using a PowerPoint presentation to ensure consistency. Instructions were similar to the ones used in . First, participants were instructed that when they receive a probe on their phone, they should take a mental snapshot of what they were thinking about just before they saw the probe. Participants were instructed to use that mental snapshot to answer the following five questions included in each probe: 1. How are you feeling right now in terms of valence (negative to positive)? Answer on a scale from 1 (very negative) to 9 (very positive). Explanation: Your feelings of valence can vary in terms of degree, which we are asking you to rate on a scale of 1 to 9. For example, 1 would be very negative feelings, whereas 9 would be very positive feelings. 2. How are you feeling right now in terms of arousal (calm to active)? Answer on a scale from 1 (very calm) to 9 (very active). Explanation: Your feelings of arousal can vary in terms of degree, which we are asking you to rate on a scale of 1 to 9. For example, 1 would be very calm/sleepy, whereas 9 would be very active/excited/fidgety. 4. Are your thoughts wandering around freely? Answer on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 6 (very much so). Explanation: Your thoughts move around freely when there is no overarching purpose or direction to your thinking. Instead, your thoughts drift from one thing to another without focusing on anything for too long. 5. Please provide a brief description of your most recent stream of thought based on the mental snapshot. (Note that this was a verification question to ensure that participants were not answering randomly.) Each question was described in detail one at a time. Explanations were provided before pausing for questions from the group. Participants were then quizzed as a group to ensure they understood the questions and probing methodology. Finally, incentives for participation were specified at the end of the power-point: one credit was given for attending the training/informed consent session, a second credit was given for answering at least 60% of the probes (i.e., metric for basic compliance), and a third credit was given for answering over 80% of the probes. to each question through a text message that was logged on a secure external server. As soon as an answer was received, the next question was triggered such that the probe set mimicked a text conversation. Questions appeared in the same order each time to reduce confusion. Each probe took less than a minute to respond. Probe sets (i.e., the set of probe questions) were delivered between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. To ensure random, yet evenly distributed probing throughout the day, the 12-hr period was parsed into three time periods: 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., and 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Probe sets were randomly triggered within each timeperiod. This probing strategy was chosen to ensure ample variability in probing times across the day (see the online supplementary material for a plot of probe times across the day). We also examined how mind-wandering at a given timepoint (t 0 ) influences affect at a subsequent timepoint (t 1 ). Each randomly delivered probe was ""paired"" with a second probe that was delivered 8 min to 12 min after the first probe set was completed. A timer for the second probe was initiated after the last question was answered in t 0 . This lag time is consistent with the procedures used in previous studies;  used multiple hour delays; however,  suggested that shorter probe times-on the order of 15 min-might be more precise for lag analyses involving affect. Two probe sets occurred in each of the three time periods, yielding six probes per day per person. Participants completed the study in one of two different groups, one week apart. The training sessions took place on Wednesdays, and probes began on Thursdays. In Group 1, participants answered probes from Thursday to Monday, receiving a total of 30 probe sets. In Group 2, participants answered probes from Thursday to Sunday, receiving a total of 24 probe sets (probes on Monday were not delivered due to an external server error causing a shutdown). Data Processing A total of 1,780 probes were answered. On average, participants responded to 77.5% (SD ϭ 13.8%) of the probes. In total, 3.8% of the probe answers contained a response outside of the allowed parameters (e.g., answering 0 for a scale of 1 to 9); those probes were excluded from data analysis. Additionally, we removed six participants who were considered noncompliant-that is, they did not respond to enough probes to receive credit for participating (responding to less than 60% of probes). This removal process follows the compliance criterion of similar experience sampling studies  given the ecological validity of experience sampling depends on the ability to sample a wide enough range of activities and situations , while ensuring a large enough intraindividual sample which is critical for the power of mixed-effects approaches. Analyses proceeded with 73 participants (1,656 total probe responses). Intraclass correlations for all variables can be found in Table , representing adequate within-subject variability in probe responses. We also note that patterns remain the same even when the noncompliant participants are included. Analytical Approach We assessed the relationships between task-unrelated thought, freely moving thought, and affect using mixed-effects linear re-gressions using the lme4 package in R . We used the raw response data for analyses, and report standardized regression values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to facilitate effect size comparison across models. Models were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood estimation with an unstructured covariance structure. All models were fitted with a random intercept only model structure (participant as random effect) which helps account for the within-subject variance in ratings across participants.  For analyses described in the following text, the dependent variable was affective dimension (valence or arousal). Models contained two key fixed effects: the two thought dimensions (task-unrelated thought and freely moving thought). Significance testing was completed with a two-tailed alpha of .05 using the chi-square test from the car package in R . Standardized regression coefficients and 95% of CIs were computed using the effectsize package and R-square values for the fixed effects were computed using the MuMIn package in R, following the recommendations of . Finally, we are also interested in drawing some comparisons about the relationships between task-unrelated thought and freely moving thought. We adopted the approach recommended by , whereby the 95% CIs of the standardized regression coefficients (ß) are compared. We adopt a very conservative version of this approach by only claiming dissociation if the intervals involve 0% overlap . Results Relationship Between Task-Unrelated Thought and Freely Moving Thought On average, participants reported being off-task 59.6% of the time (SD ϭ 20.1) across both timepoints. On a scale of 1 to 6, the average overall rating for freely moving thought was 2.89 (SD ϭ This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. .910). Whereas these numbers reflect all ratings, descriptive statistics for all key variables are provided in Table , broken down by the two separate timepoints. Previous research shows that task-unrelated thought and freely moving are positively but weakly related ). Here we replicated this finding: a mixed effects linear regression revealed that the two dimensions were positively related to one another (ß ϭ .31, 95% CI [.27, .35]), 2 (1) ϭ 229, p Ͻ .001. Task-unrelated thought (dichotomous fixed effect) explained less than 10% of the variance in freely moving thought (r 2 of fixed effect ϭ .097). Based on this relationship, both variables were included as predictors in the same model to examine their unique influence on affect without concern of multicollinearity. Relationships With Concurrent Affective State A summary of the full regression results is shown in Table . Valence. Task-unrelated thought and freely moving thought had differential relationships with concurrent subjective valence (i.e., one's current affective state): valence was negatively related to taskunrelated thought (ß ϭ Ϫ.07), 2 (1) ϭ 8.63, p ϭ .003, but positively related to freely moving thought (ß ϭ .12), 2 (1) ϭ 18.8, p Ͻ .001. The negative relationship found for task-unrelated thought replicates previous work by : off-task thought is less positive than on-task thought. However, freely moving thought was positively related to valence, providing initial evidence that the two dimensions might have dissociable correlates, especially with respect to ongoing affective states (see Table  and Figure  for evidence of nonoverlapping 95% CIs). Arousal. Task-unrelated thought was not significantly related to arousal (ß ϭ Ϫ.04), 2 (1) ϭ 1.96, p ϭ .162. In contrast, freely moving thought was positively related to arousal (ß ϭ .08),  (1) ϭ 8.12, p ϭ .004. Relationships With Subsequent Affective State Previous research suggests that task-unrelated thought might lead to more negatively valenced affective states at a subsequent timepoint, which has been used as the basis for proposals that ""mind-wandering is generally the cause, and not merely the consequence of unhappiness"" . Here we explored if the two dimensions at t 0 (the first timepoint) are predictive of affect (valence and arousal) at t 1 (subsequent timepoint). We only analyzed probes where participants responded to both t 0 and t 1 in the same time interval (deployed 8 min to 12 min apart), yielding 787 probes from all 73 participants. Lag analyses across longer intervals throughout the day or across days (e.g., overnight) were not considered, as we were interested in the specific time-locked points of t 0 and t 1 afforded by our experience sampling schedule. Valence. Similar to the concurrent affect models, valence at t 1 was regressed on task-unrelated thought and freely moving thought. Valence at t 0 was also included in the model in order to understand the unique influence of the two dimensions after controlling for the initial valence rating. Valence at t 0 was positively predictive of valence at t 1 (ß ϭ .47), 2 (1) ϭ 222, p Ͻ .001, consistent with prior research . Task-unrelated thought at t 0 was not significantly related to valence at t 1 (ß ϭ Ϫ.02), 2 (1) ϭ .230, p ϭ .632. These findings do not align with previous research;  found that task-unrelated at t 0 was negatively predictive of valence at t 1 when assessed at more distant points in time compared with the present study. In the present study, freely moving thought at t 0 was, however, a significant positive predictor of valence at t 1 even after controlling for valence at t 0 (ß ϭ .12), 2 (1) ϭ 11.2, p ϭ .001. Valence at t 0 did not predict task-unrelated thought at t 1 (ß ϭ Ϫ.02), 2 (1) ϭ .316, p ϭ .574, or freely moving thought at t 1 (ß ϭ .00), 2 (1) Ͻ .001, p ϭ .999. These effects are in line with previous work, where valence was not a strong predictor of subsequent task-unrelated thought ); here we find that freely moving thought follows a similar pattern. Arousal. Task-unrelated thought and freely moving thought at t 0 were not predictive of arousal at t 1 (ps Ͼ .1; see Table  for model details). Similarly, arousal at t 0 was not predictive of either taskunrelated thought at t 1 (ß ϭ Ϫ.01), 2 (1) ϭ .035, p ϭ .853, or freely moving thought at t 1 (ß ϭ .05), 2 (1) ϭ 2.13, p ϭ .145. Possible Interaction Effects We did not make any a priori predictions for interaction effects between task-unrelated and freely moving thought. However, for completeness, and given our claims of dissociation among the two dimensions, we tested the possibility that the relationships described above might be more appropriately described through interactions. Models were constructed similar to the ones described above with the addition of an interaction term (Task-Unrelated Thought ϫ Freely Note. Measurement scales in brackets. Note there were measurement changes across the two studies to examine whether effects were robust despite different scales. Valence and arousal changed from a 9-point scale in Study 1 (S1) to a 7-point scale in Study 2 (S2). Task-unrelated thought was a dichotomous yes/no answer in Study 1, and it was on a scale from 1 to 7 in Study 2. Freely moving thought was on a scale from 1 to 6 in Study 1 and a similar 1 to 7 scale for Study 2.

A full description of all models is included in the online supplementary materials. There were no significant interactions for concurrent valence (p ϭ .523) or subsequent valence (p ϭ .450), suggesting that the dissociations reported above did not depend on a combination of the two thought dimensions. There was evidence of a single interaction between task-unrelated thought and freely moving thought for concurrent arousal, 2 (1) ϭ 7.18, p ϭ .007. Two post hoc models revealed that when participants reported being off task, freely moving thought was not related to arousal (ß ϭ .03), 2 (1) ϭ .546, p ϭ .460. However, freely moving  Figure 1 Beta Values With 95% CIs for the Relationships Between Affect and Task-Unrelated Thought and Freely Moving Thought Across Both Studies Note.

The interaction was not observed for subsequent arousal (p ϭ .201). Relationships With Language Descriptors of Thought: Convergent Validity The open-ended responses were collected as a quality check to ensure that participants were thoughtfully (and not randomly) responding to the probes; participants were asked to type a brief description of their ""mental snapshot."" Their free-form responses also offer an additional source of data that can be used to assess convergent validity for the analyses reported above. We assessed if freely moving thought and task-unrelated thought shared differential relationships with the affective language participants used to describe their thoughts. We adopt a natural language processing (NLP) approach to quantitatively assess various aspects of sentiment for each thought description (for reviews and examples of applying NLP, see . This method is modeled after other NLP research used to examine human behavior and cognition, including emotion , comprehension  academic success , and personality  through language. Freely moving thought was expected to be positively related to positive language (and less negative language), whereas taskunrelated thought was expected to be positively related to negative language (and less positive language). We assessed these relationships by using two validated algorithms to analyze the sentiment of the participants' language. First, we examined thoughts for the level of positivity and negativity expressed using the Valence Aware Dictionary of Sentiment Reasoning (VADER; . VADER uses a validated sentiment lexicon and a rule-based system for quantifying the intensity of the sentiment expressed. We extracted two key features from VADER for each thought description: positive and negative sentiment. Second, we examined the sentiment of various parts-of-speech components (adjectives, nouns, and verbs) from the Sentiment Analysis and Social Cognition Engine (SEANCE; . We extracted four components: positive adjectives, negative adjec-tives, positive nouns, and positive verbs. (It is worth noting that parallel negative nouns and negative verbs are not part of the component indices available in SEANCE.) We also note that these approaches do not necessarily capture the complete affective intention of the participant; however, they do avoid the potential bias of human coders. Finally, we also examined verbosity through a basic word count of each thought description. Verbosity was included as an exploratory dimension based on the prediction that freely moving thoughts might cover more topics and thus involve more content. We analyzed each of the seven features by regressing them on task-unrelated thought and freely moving thought, similar to the analyses presented above (with participant as a random effect). Table  presents an overview of the models. In terms of convergent validity, we observed additional support for the idea that freely moving and task-unrelated thought have different qualitieswhich can also be observed via language. First, VADER indices suggest that task-unrelated thought is significantly less likely to contain positive words compared with on-task thought. No relationship was observed for freely moving thought for either positive or negative VADER scores. Second, SÉANCE indices shed some light on what parts of speech might differ across the two dimensions. Freely moving thought was negatively related to negative adjectives, whereas task-unrelated thought was positively related to negative adjectives (nonoverlapping 95% CI). Freely moving thought was also positively related to positive nouns; taskunrelated thought was not (though with overlapping CIs). Finally, both measures were positively related to more verbosity. However, this relationship appears stronger for freely moving thought-providing some support for the idea that freely moving thoughts might involve more content through topic shifts (nonoverlapping 95% CI). These results were exploratory and should therefore be interpreted with caution, but nevertheless provide additional support for the potential differences between the two dimensions of interest. Discussion Study 1 provides preliminary evidence that task-unrelated thought and freely moving thought might have dissociable affective profiles. First, task-unrelated thought was associated with a less positive affective state (valence) than being on-task, converg- This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. ing with results from a sentiment analysis of thought descriptions, whereas more freely moving thought was associated with more positive valence. Second, while task-unrelated thought did not correlate with arousal, freely moving thought showed a positive relationship with concurrent arousal. Third, freely moving thought at t 0 was associated with a more positive affective state at t 1 . Although these results provide a promising initial understanding of how two dimensions of thought might relate differently to affect, it is important to test whether these results will replicate in a new sample. We therefore conducted a second experience sampling study where the same four questions were administered on different numerical scales in order to assess whether (a) the findings replicated and (b) the effects were robust despite differential forms of measurement. Study 2 Method In the following text, we describe the methodological changes made in Study 2. First, a dichotomous response for the taskunrelated thought question was used in Study 1 (i.e., participants responded ""yes"" or ""no""). This decision was made in order to follow the original methodology of . However, recent research has shifted toward multilevel and numerical scales for participant responses , which is supported by  findings that dichotomous options do not necessarily capture the fact that people might not be completely engaged in or completely disengaged from their current task. Thus, the current study used the same question but with numerical response options ranging from 1 (completely on task) to 7 (completely off task), similar to the question used in . Second, we changed all four questions to be on a 7-point scale in to allow for a midpoint . This was done to ensure that participants were not forced to provide an answer on one side of the 6-point scale. The freely moving thought, valence, and arousal questions were all asked on a 7-point scale. Third, we increased the number of participants in Study 2 due to the amount of variance accounted for by the random factor (i.e., participant) in Study 1 which will allow us to test if the patterns are robust with more between-subjects variability. Study 2 thus invited 130 total participants to participate in three days of experience sampling, such that the number of participants was increased without increasing the total number of possible probes across all participants (N ϭ 18 probes per person in Study 2). Finally, we did not ask the thought description question in Study 2 to minimize time per probe. Participants In total, 122 undergraduate students (85% female; M age ϭ 19, SD age ϭ .814) at the University of New Hampshire participated for course credit. We attempted to collect data from 130, but eight people did not show up for the training session. Materials and Training With the exceptions mentioned above, other details of the study were the exact same. All participants went through the same 35-min training session. The only difference in the training sessions was that the response options were changed for the following questions: 1. How are you feeling right now in terms of valence (negative to positive)? Answer on a scale from 1 (very negative) to 7 (very positive). 2. How are you feeling right now in terms of arousal (calm to active)? Answer on a scale from 1 (very calm) to 7 (very active). 3. Are you thinking about something other than what are you currently doing? Answer on a scale of 1 (completely on task) to 7 (completely off task). 4. Are your thoughts wandering around freely? Answer on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much so). Procedure Participants completed the study in one of two different groups, two weeks apart. The training sessions took place on Tuesday, and probes began on Thursdays. Both groups received probes from Thursday to Saturday (3 days) for up to 18 probes per person. Data Processing On average, participants responded to 84.6% (SD ϭ 16.4%) of the probes. Similar to Study 1, less than 3% of the answers contained a response outside of the allowed parameters (e.g., answering 0 for a scale of 1 to 7) and were excluded from data analysis. We again removed noncompliant participants (n ϭ 12) who did not respond to enough probes to receive credit (amounting to removing 5.3% of the total probe responses). We note that statistical patterns remain the same even when these participants were included. Analytical Approach The same modeling approach was adopted from Study 1. Results Relationship Between Task-Unrelated Thought and Freely Moving Thought On a scale of 1 to 7, participants' overall average rating of taskunrelated thought was 3.93 (SD ϭ 1.07), and the average rating for freely moving thought was 3.91 (SD ϭ 1.01). See Table  for descriptive statistics of all key variables broken down by timepoint. Similar to the results from Study 1, a mixed effects linear regression revealed that the two dimensions were positively related to one another (ß ϭ .40), 2 (1) ϭ 318, p Ͻ .001. Task-unrelated thought explained less than 16% of the variance in freely moving thought (r 2 of fixed effect ϭ .158). Relationships With Concurrent Affective State Valence. The findings from Study 1 were replicated with respect to participants' subjective feelings of valence. Valence was, once again, negatively related to task-unrelated thought This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. (ß ϭ Ϫ.12), 2 (1) ϭ 21.9, p Ͻ .001, and positively related to freely moving thought (ß ϭ .06), 2 (1) ϭ 5.84, p ϭ .016. Arousal. Findings from Study 1 were not replicated with respect to arousal. Task-unrelated thought was significantly related to arousal (ß ϭ .06), 2 (1) ϭ 4.21, p ϭ .040. In contrast, freely moving thought was not significantly related to arousal (ß ϭ .00),  (1) ϭ .034, p ϭ .855. These findings diverge from Study 1 where freely moving thought was found to significantly and positively relate to arousal. Relationships With Subsequent Affective State Results from Study 1 indicate that task-unrelated thought was not strongly related to future affect, but freely moving thought was positively related to valence at a future timepoint. We attempted to replicate these results by again testing if the two dimensions at t 0 (the first timepoint) are predictive of state affect (valence and arousal) at t 1 (subsequent timepoint). Similar to Study 1, both dimensions were included in the same model along with affect at t 0 . Only probes where participants responded to both t 0 and t 1 in the same time interval were included, which yielded 841 probes from all 110 compliant participants. Valence. Valence at t 0 was positively predictive of valence at t 1 (ß ϭ .53), 2 (1) ϭ 322, p Ͻ .001, consistent with Study 1. Once again, task-unrelated thought at t 0 was not significantly related to valence at t 1 (ß ϭ .01), 2 (1) ϭ .076, p ϭ .783. Unlike the result from Study 1, freely moving thought at t 0 was not a significant predictor of valence at t 1 even after controlling for valence at t 0 (ß ϭ Ϫ.03), 2 (1) ϭ 1.07, p ϭ .302. Valence at t 0 did not predict task-unrelated thought at t 1 (ß ϭ Ϫ.04), 2 (1) ϭ 1.44, p ϭ .230, or freely moving thought at t 1 (ß ϭ .01), 2 (1) ϭ .070, p ϭ .791. Arousal. There were no significant results with respect to predicting arousal at t 1 , similar to Study 1 (see Table  for model summaries, ps Ͼ .100). Arousal at t 0 was also unrelated to taskunrelated thought (ß ϭ .02), 2 (1) ϭ .224, p ϭ .636, or freely moving thought at t 1 (ß ϭ Ϫ.01), 2 (1) ϭ .052, p ϭ .820. Possible Interaction Effects. Once again, to support our claims of dissociation, we tested the possibility that freely moving thought and task-unrelated thought interacted to influence affect. Models were constructed similar to the ones described in Study 1, where an interaction term was included (Task-Unrelated Thought ϫ Moving Freely moving Thought). Model summaries are available in the online supplemental material. Similar to Study 1, there were no significant interactions for concurrent valence (p ϭ .790) or subsequent valence (p ϭ .369), suggesting independent (and not interactive) relationships with valence. We also found no statistically significant relationships with subsequent arousal (p ϭ .362). We did, however, find an interaction for concurrent arousal (ß ϭ .05), 2 (1) ϭ 4.10, p ϭ .043. We conducted post hoc simple slopes analyses using the 'interactions' package in R; where the relationship between freely moving thought and arousal was computed at three levels of the task-unrelated thought (one standard deviation below the mean, mean, and one standard deviation above the mean). None of the simple slopes were statistically significant, but it appears that the direction of the relationship differed at values of ϩ1 SD and Ϫ1 SD: Slope for Ϫ1 SD (less of task): B ϭ Ϫ.05 (SE ϭ .03), t ϭ Ϫ1.48, p ϭ .14; slope for M, B ϭ Ϫ.01 (SE ϭ .02), t ϭ Ϫ.27, p ϭ .78; slope for ϩ 1 SD (more off-task), B ϭ .04 (SE ϭ .03), t ϭ 1.12, p ϭ .26. This is a different qualitative pattern than the results from Study 1, where freely moving thought was positively related to arousal when people reported being on-task (dichotomous response variable). In sum, we did not find reliable direct or interactive effects for arousal across both studies; see General Discussion for more on the lack of replication. Discussion Our replication study supported a key finding from Study 1; taskunrelated thought is negatively associated with valence, and freely moving thought is positively associated with valence (see Figure ). At the same time, we did not find support that freely moving thought is positively associated with arousal, and neither dimension was predictive of subsequent valence or arousal. Study 2 highlights the need for replication and further evidence in the literature while also echoing further doubt on the notion that task-unrelated thought is a direct cause of future unhappiness (see also, . General Discussion and Conclusion We provide evidence that task-unrelated thought and freely moving thought are different dimensions of thought with dissociable affective profiles: across two studies, task-unrelated thought was associated with less positive valence than being on-task, whereas freely moving thought was associated with more positive valence (see Figure  for nonoverlapping CIs across both studies). The dissociations observed for valence converged with additional exploratory analyses where natural language processing was used to assess the sentiment of the language used to describe streams of thought (Study 1). These findings are the first to demonstrate that freely moving thought does not necessarily have the same functional correlates as task-unrelated thought-specifically that it might have a more positive relationship with affect. Freely moving thought focuses on the movement in thought over time rather than a specific focus on the content of the thought itself (e.g., task-unrelated thought, or not thinking about the current task). One possibility is that such ""free"" movement in thought might positively relate to valence since positive affect tends to lead to more flexible, broader thinking . The link between broad thinking and affect might also be bidirectional; generating broad associations can lead to reductions in negative affect and increases in positive affect . In contrast, thoughts that are not moving around might either be deliberately constrained or automatically fixated on a single topic, which might lead to more negative affect . Although it is possible that thoughts are automatically constrained to a single topic like in the case of rumination, freely moving is not simply the opposite of ruminative thinking since thoughts might also be constrained deliberately (i.e., in goaldirected cognition). A limitation of this study is that we did not assess additional dimensions of thought, such as what topic(s) they were thinking about; future work might include these contentbased dimensions to tease this relationship apart further. Task-unrelated thought was related to valence in the opposite direction, which is consistent with previous studies where participants tend to report more positive feelings when they are engaged This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

However, we note that in the current study (and others), off-task thinking tends to be more neutral than starkly negative (for more discussion, see , despite on-task thinking being rated more positively. It is also worth pointing out that task-unrelated thought tends to share a negative relationship with performance and comprehension , so future work might focus on assessing whether freely moving thought has a similar negative impact on performance, or if it might offer benefits under certain circumstances (i.e., during problem solving, etc.). Given the importance of replication, it is also important to mention a number of effects that did not replicate across both studies. Freely moving thought was positively associated with concurrent arousal in Study 1, but task-unrelated thought was positively related to arousal in Study 2. These findings might be of interest given that affect is often considered to be a multidimensional construct with two orthogonal dimensions (i.e., valence and arousal; ; yet there has been less focus on the relationship between mind-wandering and arousal in relation to valence. Our exploratory analyses of arousal show that neither dimension of thought was reliably related to arousal in the context of everyday life across both studies. We also found evidence for interactive effects of freely moving thought and task-unrelated thought on arousal, but again the patterns did not replicate across studies. The changes in patterns for arousal across studies highlight the need to explore this dimension more, particularly given that patterns might have changed as a result of the changes in measurement-specifically, that taskunrelated thought explained more variance in arousal once it was measured on a 7-point scaled instead of a dichotomous one (see  for related discussions on measurement issues). The inconsistent pattern of results for task-unrelated thought and arousal (negative, nonsignificant relationship in Study 1; positive, significant relationship in Study 2) also mimics previous inconsistencies observed for physiological arousal, where different directions and strengths of the same relationships have been variable across studies . Similarly, freely moving thought only predicted subsequent valence in Study 1, which was not replicated in Study 2. Importantly, neither of our studies replicated the original effect found by ; this lack of replication has been reported elsewhere as well . Other studies have, instead, found that there are certain conditions when task-unrelated thought might predict subsequent affect: For example, Off-Task ϩ Past-Related thoughts (as determined by principal components analyses) were predictive of more negative valence in the future, while Off-Task ϩ Future-Related thought predicted more positive valence  and lower stress reactivity . These conditional effects of off-task thought suggest that including additional dimensions such as temporality (e.g., , intentionality (e.g., , and level of detail (e.g.,  will be important for follow up studies. For example, how does freely moving thought predict affect when thoughts are mostly past-related versus futureoriented? Assessing temporality will allow future studies to assess if freely moving thoughts positively relate to subjective valence due to a future-compared with past-focus. In summary, task-unrelated thought and freely moving thought are both ubiquitous in everyday life, yet freely moving thought has not been a focus of empirical research to date. This might be because task-unrelated thought became a focus of scientific study over a decade ago , whereas freely moving was brought into scientific focus relatively recently , with its corresponding experimental measure introduced even more recently . The almost exclusive focus on task-unrelated thought and its negative role in conditions such as depression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and its negative impact on learning has painted a rather negative picture of mind-wandering. However, by showing that freely moving thought has a positive relationship with affect, our findings suggest there might be positive aspects of mindwandering that remain unexplored. Exploring both dimensions in future research promises to enrich our understanding of the multitude of ways in which mind-wandering profoundly influences almost every aspect of everyday life. "
14,14,Stress reactivity as a putative mechanismlinking childhood trauma with clinical outcomesin individuals at ultra-high-risk for psychosis:Findings from the EU-GEI High Risk Study,"Aims.Childhood trauma is associated with an elevated risk for psychosis, but the psycho-logical mechanisms involved remain largely unclear. This study aimed to investigate emo-tional and psychotic stress reactivity in daily life as a putative mechanism linkingchildhood trauma and clinical outcomes in individuals at ultra-high-risk (UHR) for psychosis.Methods.Experience sampling methodology was used to measure momentary stress, affectand psychotic experiences in the daily life ofN= 79 UHR individuals in the EU-GEI HighRisk Study. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was used to assess self-reported childhoodtrauma. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, 1- and 2-year follow-up.Results.The association of stress with positive (¦Â=_0.14,p= 0.010) and negative affect (¦Â=0.11,p= 0.020) was modified by transition status such that stress reactivity was greater in indi-viduals who transitioned to psychosis. Moreover, the association of stress with negative affect(¦Â= 0.06,p= 0.019) and psychotic experiences (¦Â= 0.05,p= 0.037) was greater in individualsexposed to highv. low levels of childhood trauma. We also found evidence that decreasedpositive affect in response to stress was associated with reduced functioning at 1-year fol-low-up (B= 6.29,p= 0.034). In addition, there was evidence that the association of childhoodtrauma with poor functional outcomes was mediated by stress reactivity (e.g. indirect effect:B=_2.13,p= 0.026), but no evidence that stress reactivity mediated the association betweenchildhood trauma and transition (e.g. indirect effect:B= 0.14,p= 0.506).Conclusions.Emotional and psychotic stress reactivity may be potential mechanisms linkingchildhood trauma with clinical outcomes in UHR individuals.","[""at-risk mental state"", ""childhood abuse"", ""transition"", ""stress sensitization"", ""ecologicalmomentary assessment"", ""EMA"", ""experience sampling method"", ""ESM""]",10.1017/S2045796021000251,"Introduction Meta-analytic evidence suggests that childhood trauma (i.e. potentially harmful experiences as sexual, physical and emotional abuse as well as physical and emotional neglect;  increases transition risk in individuals at ultra-high-risk state for psychosis (UHR; . Childhood trauma is associated with the persistence of psychotic symptoms in subclinical and clinical samples . A UHR state is commonly based on three criteria : attenuated psychotic symptoms, brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms and genetic risk and deterioration syndrome. Within 2 years, 20% of UHR individuals have been reported to transition to psychosis  and a considerable proportion experience comorbid anxiety or depression . However, in recent years, declining transition rates have been reported and various reasons for this have been discussed (e.g. different clinical profiles, earlier referrals, more effective treatment; . Meta-analyses show that the majority of UHR individuals who do not transition to psychosis do not remit from UHR status within 2 years either, and show marked impairments in functioning . UHR individuals' functional level is comparable to that reported in patients with social phobia or major depressive disorder, and closer to that observed in psychosis patients than in healthy controls . Hence, the persistence of symptoms and functioning are important outcomes. Although it is well accepted that childhood trauma is associated with clinical outcomes, psychological mechanisms involved remain largely unclear. Current models of psychosis suggest that childhood trauma amplifies stress reactivity, comprising increased negative affect, decreased positive affect and increased psychotic experiences in response to minor daily stressors . Stress reactivity is thought to be a behavioural marker of stress sensitisation as a candidate mechanism underlying the association between childhood trauma and psychosis . There is evidence that stress reactivity in daily life is elevated in patients with psychosis, individuals with familial risk for psychosis, subclinical psychosis phenotypes and UHR individuals . Stress reactivity, measured with self-report questionnaires, has also been found to be associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients with first-episode psychosis . Furthermore, in adolescent service users, childhood trauma was associated with increased emotional and psychotic stress reactivity for individuals, who reported high v. low levels of trauma . This is consistent with other experience sampling studies showing elevated stress reactivity in patients of general practitioners, UHR individuals and in patients with psychosis, who have experienced childhood trauma . Taken together, these findings suggest effect modification of stress reactivity by childhood trauma or, in other words, synergistic effects of trauma and stress reactivity, in those at-risk or with psychotic disorder (i.e. an interaction or synergistic model). Furthermore, other possibilities of how childhood trauma and stress reactivity may combine with each other may be relevant . Stress reactivity may take on the role of a mediator, such that childhood trauma may impact outcomes indirectly, via pathways through stress reactivity (i.e. a mediation model). In line with this, there is evidence from cross-sectional studies using self-report questionnaires in community samples that exposure to trauma in childhood may be linked to subclinical psychotic symptoms via stress reactivity . To increase complexity further, childhood trauma may both modify stress reactivity and connect with this putative mechanism along a causal pathway via mediation . In other words, exposure to trauma may interact with, and be predictive of, stress reactivity in pathways to psychosis (i.e. a mediated synergy model). To our knowledge, only one study to date has investigated both effect modification and mediation in the same analyses in relation to psychosis, suggesting that childhood and adult disadvantage may combine in complex ways . Although stress reactivity may be an important putative risk mechanism, no study to date has investigated whether stress reactivity in UHR individuals' daily life is greater in those exposed to high levels of childhood trauma, as well as its predictive value for clinical outcomes . Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate the interplay of exposure to childhood trauma and stress reactivity as a candidate mechanism in predicting clinical outcomes in UHR individuals at 1and 2-year follow-up using experience sampling data. We tested, in light of the theoretical models outlined above, the following hypotheses (see online Supplementary Fig. ): (H1) An increase in momentary stress is associated with increased negative affect, decreased positive affect and increased psychotic experiences. (H2) The magnitude of associations between momentary stress and negative affect, positive affect and psychotic experiences is modified by childhood trauma, such that these associations are greater in individuals exposed to high v. low levels of childhood trauma (i.e. an effect modification or interaction model). (H3) Stress reactivity (measured at baseline) predicts illness severity, functioning and symptom burden at 1-and 2-year follow-up. (H4) Childhood trauma (measured at baseline) predicts illness severity, functioning and symptom burden at 1-and 2-year follow-up. The effects of childhood trauma will be mediated via pathways through stress reactivity (i.e. a mediation model). In exploratory analyses, we further aimed to investigate whether (i) the magnitude of associations between momentary stress and negative affect, positive affect and psychotic experiences is modified by transition status, and (ii) the effect of childhood trauma on transition status will be mediated via pathways through stress reactivity (i.e. a mediation model). Methods Sample The sample comprises UHR individuals from London (UK), Melbourne (Australia) and Amsterdam/The Hague (the Netherlands) recruited as part of the EU-GEI High Risk Study (European Network of National Networks studying Gene-Environment Interactions in Schizophrenia, 2014), a naturalistic prospective multicentre study that aimed to identify the interactive genetic, clinical and environmental determinants of schizophrenia. For the UK, participants were recruited from Outreach and Support in South London (OASIS), a clinical service for UHR individuals provided by the South London and Maudsley , the West London Mental Health NHS Trust (WLMHT), and a community survey of General Practitioner practices . In Melbourne, participants were recruited from the Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation (PACE) clinic, a clinical arm of Orygen Youth Health, whose catchment area includes the north-western metropolitan region of Melbourne. Dutch participants were recruited from the Early Detection for Psychosis clinics of Parnassia, The Hague, and Amsterdam UMC. All centres provide assessments and specialised clinical services for people with UHR. UHR individuals, aged 15-35 years, were eligible to participate if they met at least one of the UHR criteria as defined by the Comprehensive Assessment of At Risk Mental State (CAARMS; : (1) attenuated psychotic symptoms: the presence of subthreshold positive psychotic symptoms for at least 1 month during the past year, (2) brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms: an episode of frank psychotic symptoms that have resolved in less than 1 week without receiving treatment and (3) vulnerability: a first-degree relative with a psychotic disorder or diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder in combination with a significant drop in functioning or chronic low functioning during at least 1 month in the previous year. Exclusion criteria were: (1) the presence of a current or past psychotic disorder, (2) symptoms relevant for inclusion are explained by a medical disorder or drugs/alcohol dependency and (3) IQ < 60. Data collection Experience sampling method (ESM) measures Momentary stress, affect and psychotic experiences were assessed using the ESM , a structured diary method with high ecological validity, in which subjects are asked to report their thoughts, feelings and symptoms in daily life . At baseline, participants used a dedicated digital device for data collection (the Psymate®, www.psymate.eu/). The target constructs (i.e. stress, affect and psychotic experiences) show high and continuous variation over time. To obtain a representative sample of participants' experiences in daily life and to capture relevant variation in these target constructs with high resolution, a time-contingent sampling design with a blocked random schedule and a highsampling frequency was used for ESM data collection, i.e. ten times a day for six consecutive days at random moments within set blocks of time . In line with previous literature, data were included if ⩾20 valid responses were provided over the assessment period . A detailed description of the ESM procedure and measures is provided in online Supplementary material 2. Childhood trauma Childhood trauma was assessed using the short form of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), an established 25-item self-report measure enquiring about traumatic experiences during childhood (for detailed information see online Supplementary material 2; . Clinical outcomes Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, 1-and 2-year follow-up. As the time points for follow-up assessments varied, the data closest to 1 and 2 years after baseline were selected as follow-up data. Illness severity was assessed using the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI; . The level of functioning was assessed using the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF; American Psychiatric Association, 2002). Symptoms were assessed using the unusual thought content, perceptual abnormalities, anxiety and tolerance to normal stress subscales of the CAARMS . To ensure data quality, extensive training was provided (see online Supplementary material 3). Statistical analysis As ESM data have a multilevel structure with multiple observations (level-1) nested within participants (level-2), the 'mixed' command in Stata 15 was used to fit two-level, linear mixed models . Continuous variables of momentary stress, affect, psychotic experiences and childhood trauma were z-standardised for interpreting significant interaction terms. First, we included the composite stress measure as an independent variable and negative affect, positive affect and psychotic experiences as outcome variables (H1). Second, we added two-way interaction terms for stress × childhood trauma to examine whether the associations between momentary stress, negative affect, positive affect and psychotic experiences were modified by childhood trauma (H2). The hypothesis that the associations of momentary stress with affect and psychotic experiences were greater in individuals exposed to high v. low levels of childhood trauma (±1 S.D. of standardised CTQ scores, mean = 0, S.D. = 1) was tested by using the 'testparm' command for computing Wald tests to assess statistical significance of two-way interaction terms and the 'lincom' command to compute linear combinations of coefficients . Third, we used the 'predict' option to obtain fitted values of psychotic experiences and affect predicted by the composite stress measure. We used linear regression analysis to investigate whether these fitted values representing stress reactivity predicted illness severity, level of functioning and symptom burden at follow-up, while controlling for baseline values (H3). Finally, we performed mediation analysis using the 'gsem' command to investigate whether the effects of childhood trauma on illness severity, level of functioning and symptom burden were mediated by stress reactivity (H4). The total effect of childhood trauma on clinical outcomes was apportioned into a direct effect and an indirect effect through stress reactivity. The indirect effect was computed using the product of coefficients strategy. The indirect and the total effect were computed and tested on significance using the 'nlcom' command. Restricted maximum-likelihood (H1 and H2) or maximumlikelihood estimation (H3 and H4) were applied, allowing for the use of all available data under the relatively unrestrictive assumption that data are missing at random and if all variables associated with missing values are included in the model . Following previous studies , all analyses were adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity and centre as these are known as a priori confounders (based on evidence on the basic epidemiology of psychosis). To control for confounding of findings by comorbid disorders, all analyses were controlled for comorbid major depressive and anxiety disorders. In addition, analyses for testing H3 Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences and H4 were controlled for time to follow-up to account for variation in time to follow-up. Unadjusted analyses and sensitivity analyses in a restricted sample assessed in a ±6 month time interval around the expected follow-up time points are displayed in online Supplementary materials 4-6. Results Basic sample and clinical characteristics A total of 108 participants were assessed with the ESM during the study period. Of these, 79 participants completed ESM assessment with ⩾20 valid responses (i.e. 73.1% of 108; valid responses: M = 38, range 20-57). Assessment of clinical outcomes was completed for 48 participants at 1-year follow-up (61% of the full sample; months away from optimal 1-year follow-up time point: median = 0.5, range −8.7 to 4.6) and 36 participants at 2-year follow-up (46% of the full sample; months away from optimal 2-year follow-up time point: median = 0.5, range −5.6 to 22.6). Nine individuals (11%) transitioned to psychosis by the final follow-up time point. Participants were on average 23 years old (S.D. = 4.93) and 56% were women. The majority (67%) of the sample was white, followed by 15% with black ethnicity. Seventy-six percent of the participants were diagnosed with a comorbid axis I disorder. Comparing the current study's participants to individuals included in the EU GEI High-Risk study, for whom ESM data were not collected (N = 266), there were no differences in demographics (age: t = −1.33, p = 0.185; gender: χ 2 = 3.58, p = 0.059; ethnicity: χ 2 = 6.53, p = 0.258) or overall prevalence of comorbid disorders (χ 2 = 1.82, p = 0.177). However, the current sample showed higher levels of childhood trauma (t = −2.59, p = 0.010), a higher prevalence of specific phobias (χ 2 = 4.86, p = 0.027) and a lower prevalence of major depressive disorder (χ 2 = 4.67, p = 0.031) compared to participants, for whom ESM data were not collected (see Table ). Association between momentary stress, affect and psychotic experiences (H1) Momentary stress was associated with small to moderate increases in negative affect (β = 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.36, p < 0.001) and psychotic experiences (β = 0.16, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.20, p < 0.001) as well as with a moderate decrease in positive affect (β = −0.38, 95% CI −0.43 to −0.34, p < 0.001). Association between momentary stress, affect and psychotic experiences by childhood trauma (H2) Childhood trauma modified the associations of momentary stress with negative affect (stress × childhood trauma: β = 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.06, p = 0.019) and psychotic experiences (stress × childhood trauma: β = 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.05, p = 0.044, see Table ). These associations were greater in individuals with higher levels of childhood trauma (outcome negative affect: high v. low childhood trauma: β = 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11, p = 0.019; outcome psychotic experiences: high v. low childhood trauma: β = 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.09, p = 0.044). Furthermore, we found a non-significant indication that childhood trauma modified the association between momentary stress and positive affect (stress × childhood trauma: β = 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.06, p = 0.081). Stress reactivity and clinical outcomes at follow-up (H3) Decreased positive affect in response to stress was associated with higher illness severity (B = −0.51, 95% CI −0.97 to −0.06, p = 0.028) and lower level of functioning (B = 7.92, 95% CI 1.39 to 14.45, p = 0.019) at 1-year follow-up (see Table ). In addition, the level of functioning at 2-year follow-up was predicted by psychotic stress reactivity (B = 11.62, 95% CI 1.70 to 21.54, p = 0.024). 1 Increased negative affect in response to stress predicted unusual thought content at 2-year follow-up (B = 1.74, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.11, p = 0.016). Moreover, perceptual abnormalities at 1-year follow-up were predicted by emotional (negative affect: B = 1.24, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.93, p = 0.001; positive affect: B = −1.03, 95% CI −1.81 to −0.25, p = 0.011) and psychotic stress reactivity (B = 1.06, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.83, p = 0.009). There was no evidence that emotional or psychotic stress reactivity predicted anxiety or tolerance to normal stress. Emotional and psychotic stress reactivity as mediators of the association between childhood trauma and clinical outcomes (H4) Table  shows findings on total, direct and indirect effects of childhood trauma and stress reactivity on clinical outcomes at follow-up. Increased negative affect in response to stress mediated the association of childhood trauma and illness severity at 1-year follow-up (indirect effect: B = 0.20, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.38, p = 0.033). We found no evidence that emotional and psychotic stress reactivity mediated the association of childhood trauma and level of functioning. The association of childhood trauma and unusual thought content at 2-year follow-up was mediated by increased negative affect in response to stress (B = 0.42, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.80, p = 0.030). In addition, the association of childhood trauma and perceptual abnormalities at 1-year follow-up was mediated by increased negative affect (indirect effect: B = 0.39, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.69, p = 0.011) and psychotic experiences in response to stress (indirect effect: B = 0.44, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.75, p = 0.005). High levels of childhood trauma were associated with more intense reactivity in the form of a stronger increase of negative affect and psychotic experiences in response to stress, which, in turn, was associated with higher illness severity, unusual thought content and perceptual abnormalities at follow-up. We found no evidence for direct effects of childhood trauma on anxiety and tolerance to normal stress and no mediation via stress reactivity. In exploratory analyses, there was no evidence for a direct effect of childhood trauma on transition status and no mediation via stress reactivity (see online Supplementary material 7). Discussion Main findings Using an experience sampling design, we found strong evidence that minor daily stressors were associated with emotional and psychotic stress reactivity in UHR individuals (H1). Childhood 1 This counterintuitive finding can be explained by centre and time to follow-up acting as suppressor variables (i.e. these variables suppressed, in part the variance of the independent variable of psychotic stress reactivity). When we examined the associations among independent and outcome variables, we found the typical pattern as it would be expected for suppressor effects: centre and time to follow-up were not correlated with the outcome variable but showed substantial associations with other independent variables. Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences 5 trauma modified the effect of daily stressors on negative affect and psychotic experiences, with more intense psychotic experiences and stronger increases in negative affect for individuals exposed to high levels of childhood trauma (H2). In addition, we found some evidence to suggest stress reactivity predicts clinical outcomes at follow-up (H3). Finally, there was partial evidence that stress reactivity mediates the association of childhood trauma and clinical outcomes (H4). Methodological considerations/limitations The reported findings should be interpreted in light of several methodological considerations. First, childhood trauma was measured with a retrospective self-report questionnaire. A common concern about retrospective self-report is that recall bias and cognitive distortions might lead to invalid ratings . However, good reliability and validity for these measures have been reported in individuals with psychosis . Similar levels of agreement between the self-report and interviewer-rated retrospective reports of childhood trauma have been observed in individuals with first-episode psychosis and population-based controls . Other types of childhood adversity not assessed (e.g. bullying victimisation) might also be relevant . Second, ESM is a burdensome research method, which may lead to sampling and selection bias. For example, one way this may have operated on findings may be that individuals with more intense symptoms may have been underrepresented in the sample, as assessment burden may have discouraged eligible individuals with severe symptoms from participation. In addition, it may be more challenging for individuals with more severe symptoms to reach sufficient compliance, which may lead to underrepresentation due to the exclusion of these participants. However, we found no differences in clinical characteristics at baseline when comparing participants included in the analysis to individuals for whom ESM data were not available. Third, follow-up intervals varied, which was accounted for by controlling for time to follow-up and conducting sensitivity analyses with a restricted sample (leading to similar results in terms of magnitude of associations but some variation in statistical significance due to varying sample sizes). Fourth, unmeasured confounders (e.g. polygenic risk) may have influenced the reported findings. Fifth, although an increasingly common finding in the field , we need to consider the small number of nine individuals (11%) who transitioned to psychosis within the follow-up period. The findings should therefore be re-evaluated in a larger sample with higher transition rates. In addition, comorbidity, especially comorbid major depressive and anxiety disorders, should be taken into account. Therefore, all analyses were controlled for comorbid major depressive and anxiety disorders. Sixth, the use of a composite stress measure should be critically discussed. In line with previous studies, we aggregated event-related, activity-related and social stress for each beep to reduce multiple testing (Pries   . Still, type I error should be taken into account when interpreting the results. Comparison with previous research In accordance with previous ESM studies, we found that momentary stress was associated with small to moderate increases in negative affect and psychotic experiences and moderate decreases in positive affect in UHR individuals . When considering the role of childhood trauma and stress reactivity in clinical trajectories, several possibilities of how these may combine with each other may be relevant . Following , we investigated both effect modification and mediation in the same analyses. In accordance with suggested models and recent ESM studies, we found that childhood trauma amplifies reactivity to minor stress in daily life . Furthermore, we found some evidence that stress reactivity predicted clinical outcomes at follow-up. This extends findings from a previous ESM study in the general population and an observational study in patients with first-episode psychosis . Going one step further, there was some evidence that stress reactivity mediated the association of childhood trauma and clinical outcomes at follow-up. High levels of childhood trauma were associated with an increased stress reactivity, which, in turn, was associated with worse clinical outcomes at follow-up. Hence, this tentatively suggests that childhood trauma may both modify stress reactivity and exert detrimental effects via stress reactivity and push individuals along more severe clinical trajectories. Overall, this adds evidence in support of a mediated synergy model . Conclusion Taken together, our findings underscore the relevance of reactivity to daily stressors as a putative mechanism linking childhood trauma with clinical outcomes in UHR individuals. Adding evidence to the mediated synergy model, the study suggests early adversity in childhood links to more severe clinical trajectories via, and in interaction with, subsequently elevated stress reactivity in adulthood. Therefore, the findings underline the relevance of ecological momentary interventions targeting stress reactivity in daily life (e.g. EMIcompass, a transdiagnostic ecological momentary intervention for improving resilience in youth;  as an important next step towards improving clinical outcomes in UHR individuals at an early stage .

15,15,Impact of self-efficacy on daily intention to not smoke,"Background: To improve cessation interventions, it is necessary to understand the factors associated with daily motivation to not smoke. One hypothesized factor is self-efficacy; however, there has been a lack of evidence investigating self-efficacy as a dynamic construct. Methods: This study examined the influence of baseline and daily self-efficacy on setting daily abstinence plans in pre-quit smokers and successful plans. Participants (N = 76) completed measures of self-efficacy at baseline, and each evening during 28 days of ecological momentary assessment. Results: Baseline self-efficacy was not correlated with mean daily rating of self-efficacy or variance in ratings. GLMM found that participants who had higher baseline self-efficacy than others were more likely to set an abstinence plan while participants who had a higher rating of self-efficacy on the previous night than others were more likely to set a plan on any given morning. Participants were less likely to set an abstinence plan if they had smoked on the previous day but were more likely if they had set an abstinence plan on the previous day. Participants were less likely to have a successful plan not to smoke if they smoked on the previous day. Conclusions: The current data indicates that both baseline rating and day-to-day fluctuations in SE influence daily abstinence plan in pre-quit smokers. Future intervention research could examine the use of methods designed to increase and maintain a person's daily self-efficacy and how this can be leveraged to encourage these smokers to attempt long-term cessation.","[""Self-efficacy"", ""Smoking"", ""Ecological Momentary Assessment"", ""Abstinence""]",10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.106877,"Introduction Despite large-scale public health campaigns to encourage cigarette smokers to quit, cigarette smoking continues to be a leading cause of preventable diseases such as cancer, chronic lung disease, stroke, and heart disease . Data from 2000 to 2015 show that most U.S. smokers (70%) expressed that they wanted to quit smoking. However every year only approximately 55% of adult smokers made a quit attempt that lasted at least 24 h, and the vast majority (93%) of these quit attempts ended in relapse within 6 months . To reduce the smoking-related public health burden and improve cessation interventions, it is necessary to identify and better understand the factors that improve rates of both quit attempts and successful smoking cessation. Motivation to quit smoking (or ""readiness to quit"") has been an important construct guiding the smoking cessation field for several decades. Several motivational factors (e.g., self-reported ratings of wanting to quit, concerns about the health and financial cost of smoking, and stubbing out unfinished cigarettes) are predictive of future quit attempts . Interestingly, even smokers who are interested in quitting, but not yet ready to commit to this long-term behavior change, engage in brief quit attempts. For example, it was found that individuals who were contemplating smoking cessations made 3 times as many 24hour quit attempts than those who were not contemplating , and previous quit attempts has been associated with increased motivation to quit in the future . Given that enhancing motivation and intention to quit in individuals who are not yet ready to attempt long-term abstinence is considered an important feature of several smoking interventions , it is critical to better understand factors associated with motivation to not smoke regardless of formal plans for long-term cessation. One factor that has been hypothesized to influence abstinence motivation in smokers who are actively attempting long-term cessation is self-efficacy (SE, i.e., confidence in one's ability to abstain from smoking). First identified in Social Cognitive Theory as an important component of behavior change , individuals who believe that they can initiate behavior change (i.e., have high SE) may be more likely to change their behavior. Several studies examining the potential relationship between SE and smoking behavior following a quit attempt indicate that greater SE is associated with lower rates of relapse  and/or increased likelihood of successful cessation . However, the link between SE and smoking behavior is less clear for individuals who have not yet started their quit attempt. A meta-analysis study found the relationship between baseline SE and successful cessation is stronger when SE was assessed post-quit compared to prior to a quit attempt. However, this relationship was weakened when controlling for smoking status at the time of SE assessment . One possible reason for the relatively weak associations between SE--when SE is measured prior to a quit attempt--and cessation success is that previous cross-sectional studies typically measured SE at a single time point using scales such as the Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SEQ-12), which assesses confidence to abstain from smoking when facing hypothetical internal stimuli (e.g., feeling nervous) and external stimuli (e.g., being with a smoker). But self-reports of SE made at a single time point before quitting may be influenced by unrealistic expectations, as individuals may have limited ability to project how they will feel or act in circumstances different from their current ones . It is likely that SE changes over time, regardless of whether the individual is quitting, and that these variations in SE may be more predictive of smoking and non-smoking intentions, which can themselves be dynamic and predictive for lapse during a quit attempt . To our knowledge, only two previous studies has examined if dynamic day-to-day variations in self-efficacy predicted success in quit attempts. In adults, baseline SE accounted for the predictive power of day-to-day variations in SE predicting lapse on the subsequent day . In adolescents, baseline SE was not predictive of lapse but daily variations in SE predicted the first lapse as well as relapse . However, these measurements were taken during the weeks following actual long-term quit attempts. While previous work has found that SE is higher in smokers explicitly ready to make a quit attempt compared to those who are contemplating , suggesting that increasing SE may enhance the likelihood of preparation for a quit attempt, it remains unclear whether similar variations in SE are associated with smoking behavior in individuals who are contemplating quitting but are not yet starting a formal cessation attempt. To address these gaps in the literature this secondary analysis of a larger 28-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study--with current smokers who were not currently engaged in a long-term quit attempt--examined whether baseline SE and daily SE fluctuations were related to daily abstinence plans (operationally defined as morning selfreports of an intention to not smoke that day). We hypothesized that 1) daily SE would be more predictive of daily abstinence plans compared to baseline SE; 2) within-person differences in daily SE would have a larger effect on daily abstinence plans compared to between-person differences; and 3) baseline and daily SE would be positively associated with successful abstinence plans (operationally defined as no smoking on days that they planned to not smoke). Materials and methods Sample For this paper, we analyzed data from a larger study examining naturalistic smoking in cohabitating couples in the greater Los Angeles area in which at least one individual was a daily current smoker. Participants were recruited from physical flyers, advertisements on Craigslist, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and word of mouth. The primary inclusion criteria were fluency in English and current smoking status, which was confirmed by a baseline breath carbon monoxide reading of at least 5 ppm. At baseline, participants reported smoking an average of 9.5 (SD = 6.2) cigarettes a day for the past 30 days. The current analysis examined 28 days of daily diary and baseline data from 76 smokers (51.5% female, Mean age = 42.2 ± 12.2 years) enrolled in the study between August 26, 2018 and March 1, 2020. All aspects of the study were approved by the University of Southern California Institutional Review Board. Procedures Informed consent was obtained at an in-person baseline visit. A baseline survey was administered through REDCap that assessed demographic and smoking behaviors and beliefs. Participants were instructed to download the LifeData application (www.lifesatacorp. com) on their personal smartphone. Participants were trained on how to use the study application through verbal and written instructions. EMA data were wirelessly uploaded and stored on a secure Internet-accessible server. Data collection began the day after the baseline visit. Participants were instructed to self-initiate a morning survey after waking and an evening survey right before going to bed and to answer 3 randomly delivered surveys every day for 28 days. For the purposes of this analysis, only morning and evening survey data are presented. Participants were paid based on their compliance each week (<65%, 65-85%, and > 85%) and received up to $300 for completing the EMA. Measures Baseline measures 2.3.1.1. Demographics. The baseline questionnaire collected demographics such as participant age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, work status, and income level. FTND. Nicotine dependence was measured using the Fagerström Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) , which includes six questions measuring cigarette dependence severity. Scores range from 0 to 10. The Cronbach alpha was 0.59 which indicates moderate internal consistency. The validity and reliability of the FTND has been shown in previous studies (de . Contemplation Ladder. Readiness to consider smoking cessation was measured using the Contemplation Ladder , which visually quantifies an individual's quit motivation and has been validated in adult smokers and is uniquely suited to measure relatively lower levels of readiness for behavior change . The lowest score of 0 represents ""no thought of quitting"", whereas the highest score of 10 represents ""taking action to quit (e.g., cutting down, enrolling in a program)"". Baseline SE. Self-efficacy was measured using the Self-Efficacy/Temptations Scale . Smokers were asked to rate how confident they are not to smoke in the situations represented by the 20 items (i.e., When things are not going my way and I am frustrated, With friends at a party, When I feel I need a lift) and total scale score was used to assess general level of confidence in quitting smoking. The scale has shown previous construct and predictive validity . Answer options were:1-Not at all confident not to smoke cigarettes, 2-Not very confident not to smoke cigarettes, 3-Moderately confident not to smoke cigarettes, 4-Very confident not to smoke cigarettes, 5-Extremely confident not to smoke cigarettes. The Cronbach alpha for the scale was 0.97, which indicates extreme internal consistency. Daily measures 2.3.2.1. Daily abstinence plan. In the morning survey, participants selfreported their intention to smoke on that day with the question ""Do you plan to not smoke today?"" (1= ""yes, I plan to not smoke today"" 0= ""no, I plan to smoke today"") 2.3.2.2. Daily SE. In the bedtime survey, participants rated their selfefficacy using the question ""How confident are you that you will be able to quit smoking and stay quit?"" (1 = Not at all confident…5 = Extremely confident). In analysis, daily self-efficacy was lagged to day t − 1 so previous night's self-efficacy predicted next day's behavior. Smoking behavior. Number of cigarettes smoked was measured at the bedtime survey through the question ""How many cigarettes did you smoke today?"" Given that these data were primarily used to assess successful abstinence intentions, we transformed smoking into a binary variable representing if the participant smoked that day to match the responses of the morning abstinence plan measure (1 = yes, smoked today, 0 = no, did not smoke today). As a validity check, a subset of participants received CO monitors and the number of cigarettes reported in the bedtime survey was correlated with breath CO (r = 0.982, p < .001). Statistical analysis In order to characterize survey compliance for this sample, we first conducted preliminary Pearson's correlations associating survey completion rates with each variable of interest (i.e., all demographic variables, FTND, contemplation ladder, and baseline and daily SE). Additional preliminary analyses included correlations testing bivariate associations between baseline SE, daily SE (mean and variance), mean number of daily cigarettes, proportion of days with an abstinence plan, and proportion of smoking days. For hypothesis testing, multilevel mixed-effects logistic regressions were conducted to account for the within-person clustering of observations. For each model, daily SE was disaggregated at the day level (within-subjects) and person-level (between subjects) and scores were person-centered for both. The between-subject (BS) level represents the deviation of one's own mean from the group mean across all available prompts, while the within-subject (WS) level represents any given prompt's deviation from one's own mean across all available prompts. To satisfy the causal requirement that a predictor must precede the behavior that it aims to predict, daily SE was lagged to day t − 1 such that daily SE would predict the next day's smoking behavior. Lagged variables representing abstinence plan on the previous day and smoking behavior on the previous day were created. To assess which covariates should be included in the hypothesis-testing models, separate univariate models assessed the relationship between baseline SE, daily SE (WS and BS), smoking behavior on the previous day, plan on the previous day, FTND, contemplation ladder rating, demographics and next day abstinence plan. WS daily SE, FTND, and contemplation ladder rating were not significantly associated with abstinence plan (ps > 0.05) but WS daily SE and FTND were still included in the final model as a priori covariates. To test whether daily SE was more predictive of daily abstinence plans than baseline SE (hypothesis 1), and whether within-person differences in daily SE would have a larger effect than between-person differences on daily abstinence plans (hypothesis 2), we examined the relationship between significant predictors and covariates from univariate models (baseline SE, WS and BS daily SE, smoking on previous day, plan on previous day, sex, FTND, age) and daily abstinence plan. To further explore the relationship between SE and success of abstinence plan (hypothesis 3), a second model was built examining the relationship between the same predictors but with the outcome of a successful abstinence plan (i.e., days in which participants reported planning to not smoke at the morning survey followed by reporting zero cigarettes smoked at the bedtime survey). Analyses were conducted in Stata (Version 15). For all analyses, p < 0.05 was considered a statistically significant effect. Results Survey compliance Participants completed an average of 25.83 days (SD = 4.99; range: 7-28). Accounting for non-completers, there were a maximum of 1963 person-day number of surveys (92.24%). Participants completed 1509 (76.87%) self-initiated morning surveys and 1260 (64.19%) bedtime surveys. Individual compliance was calculated as number of surveys completed/number of days in the study. Individual morning survey compliance ranged from 7.14% to 100% with a mean of 74.06% (SD = 26.41). Individual bedtime survey compliance ranged from 7.41% to 100% with a mean of 61.86% (SD = 25.46). The data was analyzed for patterns of missingness by running correlations. Compliance for the morning survey was correlated with the bedtime survey compliance (r = 0.81, p < 0.001) and FTND score (r = -0.33, p = .004). Participants who self-identified as White (r = 0.28, p = .02) or had higher income (r = 0.29, p = .01) had higher compliance. The proportion of missing data for the bedtime survey (daily SE, smoking behavior) was not correlated with the within-person mean for that variable or any other variables besides morning survey compliance (p > .05). Participant characteristics Sample demographics and other baseline measures are shown in Table . The majority of participants self-identified as Black or African American (55.3%) and non-Hispanic (85.5%). On average, participants smoked on 91.8% (SD = 0.27) of days and set an abstinence plan on 45.0% (SD = 0.33) of days. Participants who planned not to smoke on a day were only successful on 16.87% (SD = 0.37) of days. Mean daily SE was 3.17 (SD = 1.38). There was withinperson variability in daily SE over time demonstrated by an intraclass correlation of 0.63 (WS variance = 0.69, BS variance = 1.16). Mean reported number of cigarettes smoked was 6.03 (SD = 5.55). Bivariate associations between baseline SE, daily SE, and smoking variables Bivariate correlations (not accounting for the nested data structure) using cross-sectional person-level data showed that average daily SE was negatively correlated with average number of daily cigarettes (r = − 0.26, p = 0.03) and positively correlated with a higher proportion of days of setting an abstinence plan (r = 0.41, p < .01). Proportion of days with an abstinence plan was negatively correlated with the mean number of cigarettes (r = − 0.34, p < .01). The proportion of smoking days was significantly negatively correlated with average daily SE (r = − 0.44, p < .01) and proportion of days with an abstinence plan (r = − 0.41, p < .01). Baseline SE was not significantly correlated with mean daily SE (r = 0.18, p = 0.13) or variance in daily SE (r = − 0.10, p = .40). Hypothesis testing of associations between SE, abstinence plans, and smoking A multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression further explored the above bivariate relationships while accounting for the nested nature of the data (ICC = 0.29). Results are summarized in Table . Daily SE ratings were more predictive of daily abstinence plans than baseline SE (hypothesis 1). That is, individuals who had higher ratings of SE on a previous night than others (i.e., between-subject daily SE) and those with higher baseline SE were 67.8% and 2.3%, respectively, more likely to set an abstinence plan on any given morning. In contrast, withinsubject daily SE (i.e., differences of an individual's SE ratings on a previous night relative to their own average) was not associated with abstinence plan (hypothesis 2). Additionally, participants were 66% less likely to set an abstinence plan if they smoked on the previous day but were 288% more likely to set a plan again if they had set one on the previous day. Finally, neither baseline nor daily SE was significantly associated with successful abstinence plans (hypothesis 3). However, participants were 81% less likely to have a successful abstinence plan if they smoked on the previous day. Discussion We found evidence that participants who had higher baseline selfefficacy than others were more likely to set abstinence plans over the course of the study, and participants who had higher ratings of previousnight daily self-efficacy than others were more likely to set a plan on the next morning. Participants were less likely to set an abstinence plan if they had smoked on the previous day, but were more likely if they had also set an abstinence plan on the previous day. Participants were also less likely to have a successful intention not to smoke if they smoked on the previous day. Additionally, the current results indicating both within-person variability in daily SE over time and the lack of an association between daily SE and baseline SE suggests that studying SE as a time varying process could be beneficial for future research. Overall, these data are consistent with previous work indicating that SE is associated with abstinence during actual long-term quit attempts . On the other hand, these results are seemingly inconsistent with previous studies suggesting that SE may not be associated with the likelihood of starting a long-term quit attempt . Nevertheless, the current study extends previous work by examining the relationship between fluctuations in SE and abstinence plans in current smokers who were contemplating behavior change but not engaged in formal long-term quit attempts. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that that daily SE--compared with baseline SE--was more predictive of self-reporting a daily abstinence plan. Participants with higher ratings of SE on a previous night than others were 67.8% more likely to set abstinence plans while those with higher baseline SE were only 2.3% more likely. One possible explanation for this finding is that self-efficacy is dynamic and changes over time . Thus a static baseline measure of SE (that assesses how individuals will feel about their smoking behavior under future hypothetical circumstances) may have limited explanatory power when confronted with actual momentary decisions to temporarily abstain from smoking, and may partially explain why previous work has found little evidence of SE associating with overall intention to stop smoking ). An alternative explanation could be that the baseline and daily SE scales used in this study measure different constructs. The SE scale used at baseline has participants rate their situational SE while the daily measure was a single item of general cessation SE. Future research might assess both situational and general SE at  Level-1 includes predictors that are time-varying (i.e., momentary) and Level-2 includes predictors that are stable across days (i.e., personal characteristics). WS = Within-subjects (centered from the person-level mean); BS = Between-subjects (person-level mean). baseline to evaluate the relationship between these two potentially different constructs. Nevertheless, the current results provide evidence consistent with the idea that enhancing SE in smokers who are not yet ready to quit smoking might increase their engagement in abstinencerelated behaviors. Contrary to our hypotheses, we did not find evidence for a stronger association between within-subject SE and abstinence plans. Rather, we found that between-person differences in daily SE--but not withinperson differences in daily SE--was positively associated with likelihood of reporting daily abstinence plans. While it is not clear why within-person SE was unrelated to abstinence plans, one possibility is that setting plans is a stable behavior that has been established through experience and is not influenced by occasional changes from one's average. Nevertheless, a strength of the study was the disaggregation of within-and between-person effects and--while previous data indicate that higher baseline SE and day-level SE may be associated with smoking fewer cigarettes in smokers who are not abstaining )--to our knowledge, the current study was the first to examine associations of day-level SE and abstinence plans. While our data suggest that between-person differences in SE may be of primary importance in explaining willingness to temporarily abstain from smoking, the impact of an individual's immediate level of SE on smoking intentions remains to be determined. Neither baseline nor daily measures of SE were predictive of successful intentions (non-smoking behavior on the day of an abstinence plan). It is possible that SE is unrelated to successful temporary abstinence in individuals who are not yet ready to start a formal quit attempt. On the other hand, this null finding may be due to limited number of data points for this smoking outcome. One limitation of the study was the level of missing data, which limited the number of matched completed morning surveys (in which we measured plans) and bedtime surveys (in which we measured smoking outcomes). Additionally, due to a lack of consecutive days of data, we were unable to run an analysis about clusters of quit plan days to examine if individuals higher in SE are more likely to have multiple consecutive-day abstinence plans. While our missing data analysis showed that bedtime surveys were likely missing at random, there were person-level factors that predicted morning survey compliance. Future studies should enhance compliance by including more survey reminders and checking in with participants on specific days or after a sequence of missed surveys to problem solve and encourage survey completion. The current findings should be interpreted in the context of several additional limitations. First, there may have been the demand characteristics, such that participants may have felt compelled to appear highly confident about abstaining and setting abstinence plans despite being told at training that they could smoke as they wished in the study. Second, this study only collected ratings of SE on the day level. It is possible that SE may further vary throughout the day and future studies should use EMA to collect intensive, multiple observations of SE throughout the day to better understand the temporal patterns and momentary processes that influence smoking behavior. Third, it is important to note that it is unclear whether daily abstinence plans set by participants were intended to be plans to abstain for the day (24 h) or part of a goal for an ongoing, long-term quit attempt. Thus, it is not clear how these abstinence plans are related to actual smoking cessation. Finally, many participants frequently set but never met their nonsmoking intention across the study. Smokers may have a stable goaldirected intention to quit smoking but have daily or momentary shifts in intentions due to non-behavioral factors such as cravings and cues that can induce lapses. Previous studies have found that SE decreased as urge to smoke and negative affect increased . Additionally, baseline SE may interact with momentary SE and high activation, boredom, and difficulty concentrating . Thus, further research is needed to construct a model that accounts momentary changes in affect, smoking urge, and environmental contexts that may impact efforts to not smoke. The purpose of this study was to study the relationship between baseline and daily SE and daily abstinence plans in a diverse sample of smokers who were not ready to attempt long-term smoking cessation. As the majority of US smokers (70%) express that they want to quit smoking, it is essential that more research is conducted to understand the factors that contribute to motivation to not smoke regardless of formal plans for long-term cessation. The current results highlight the difficulty of temporary smoking abstinence and support existing reviews indicating that past behavior is an important predictor of future behavior . These data are consistent with the idea that improvements in smoking cessation outcomes may be influenced by methods designed to both increase a person's overall level of confidence that they can quit smoking, as well as reinforce the idea that making daily abstinence plans may contribute to a longer multi-day quit attempt. Future research should further focus on the temporal patterns of fluctuations in SE and how this relates to both setting an intention to quit and successful long-term cessation. "
16,16,"Insights from a laboratory and naturalistic investigation on stress, rumination and frontal brain functioning in MDD: An fNIRS study","Recent research has emphasized rumination as an important maintaining factor in various mental disorders. However, operationalization and therefore induction of rumination in experimental settings poses a major challenge in terms of ecological validity. As stress seems to play a key role in everyday situations eliciting rumination, we conducted two stress paradigms while assessing behavioral and neurophysiological measures.Aiming to replicate previous findings on induced rumination by means of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and comparing them to physiological (pain) stress, a clinical sample of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; n = 22) and healthy controls (HC; n = 23) was recruited. Cortical blood oxygenation was assessed during the stress paradigms using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Further, we used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of stress, rumination and mood to be able to correlate ruminative responses during induced stress and everyday rumination.Our results showed that social stress but not physiological stress induced depressive rumination in MDD but not in HC. Further, rumination reactivity in response to social stress but not to physiological stress was significantly associated with rumination reactivity in everyday life as assessed with EMA. With respect to cortical oxygenation, MDD subjects showed hypoactivity in the Cognitive Control Network during the TSST, which mediated the differences between MDD and HC in post-stress rumination.Our findings emphasize the role of negative social triggers in depressive rumination and validate the TSST as an induction method for depressive rumination. The results inform future developments in psychotherapeutic treatment for depressive rumination.","[""Rumination"", ""Trier Social Stress Test"", ""TSST"", ""Socially Evaluated Cold-Pressor Test"", ""SECPT"", ""functional near-infrared spectroscopy"", ""fNIRS"", ""Repetitive negative thought"", ""Major Depressive Disorder""]",10.1016/j.ynstr.2021.100344,"Introduction Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a mental disorder with high prevalence, high burden of disease and relatively high recurrence . One of its pathological factors that is associated with the severity, treatment response and recurrence is the cognitive-affective process of rumination , which is why recent treatment developments try to tackle this process directly . Depressive rumination is a perseverative cognitive process characterized by a highly self-referential, pessimistic and abstract style of thinking about problems, with little or no goal-and change-orientation . Although depressive rumination is defined as a cognitive process, it is important to note that rumination is grounded on negative emotions of an ongoing internal conflict. The process of rumination is a rather common phenomenon of thinking in humans; however, MDD subjects ruminate more often and for longer periods of time, with lower controllability . It is hypothesized that rumination has a maintaining effect on negative emotions, as the mental conflict that causes negative emotions is upheld. Indeed, patients often report that even more memories of negatively loaded past events are activated through rumination. First evidence for the maladaptive role of rumination in response to stress comes from two studies using ecological momentary assessments (EMA) in students  and subjects with MDD and generalized anxiety disorder . These studies highlight that rumination after stressful life events predicts elevated levels of negative affect and symptoms at later time points. Previous studies have shown the reciprocity of stress and rumination, in a way that stress induces depressive rumination on the one hand  and that the stress response itself is influenced by depressive rumination on the other hand . In a previous study, we investigated an adapted version of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST;  in high and low habitual ruminators with additional measurements of cortical oxygenation by means of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) . We replicated the findings of previous studies on the induction of rumination using the TSST and could further show that during the TSST high trait ruminators show reduced cortical activity in the Cognitive Control Network (CCN), a cortical network of mostly fronto-parietal regions involved in the implementation of cognitive control in various contexts . This decrease mediated the group differences between high and low trait ruminators in post-stress rumination and negative affect . While these results establish the TSST's ability to induce rumination, two points remain unclear. They do not show that the induced rumination, especially in patients with MDD, is specific to social stress, nor do they show that laboratory-induced rumination is comparable to everyday rumination. Evidence that depressive rumination is specific to social stressors, combined with a validated method to induce it in controlled circumstances, could inform the development of new psychotherapeutic treatments. The current study investigates the following three research questions: Can the previous findings on induced rumination by means of the TSST be replicated in a clinical sample of MDD patients? Are the behavioral and neural effects specific to primary psychosocial stress in comparison to physiological (pain) stress? Are the behavioral parameters as assessed with the TSST related to everyday rumination gathered with EMA? To answer these questions 22 subjects with MDD and 23 healthy controls (HC) completed an evaluation panel consisting of the TSST, an adapted version of the Social Evaluated Cold Pressor Test (SECPT) to induce physiological (pain) stress, and a two-week EMA on stress, rumination and mood. During the TSST and SECPT cortical blood oxygenation was measured by means of fNIRS in areas of the CCN. We hypothesized that the TSST would induce elevated negative affect and state rumination in general but especially in the MDD group. In contrast, we expected that the SECPT would not influence state rumination but only negative affect. In comparison to the SECPT, the conducted tasks during the TSST include social critical situations such as a job interview and an arithmetic task, which should be more strongly related to conflict-laden cognitive schemata in MDD patients than a physiological stress induction. Further, we expected that the TSST stress and rumination reactivity would be more strongly related to EMA measures of every-day stress and rumination than SECPT measures. Finally, in line with the rich literature on neural correlates of psychological and physiological stress inductions , we expected the TSST to increase activity in the CCN and the SECPT to increase activity in the IFG. With respect to differences between the groups, we expected that the MDD group would show reduced activity in prefrontal CCN regions in comparison to the HC group and that this hypoactivation would mediate the relation between group membership and post-stress rumination. Finally, we explored in how far state rumination is associated with prefrontal activity in both groups. Materials and methods Participants. A total of 55 participants were recruited (see supplementary Fig. ), seven of which withdrew from the study before the first measurement date; two participants were excluded as they either fainted during the SECPT (n = 1) or due to excessive stress associated with the study (n = 1). The final sample included 22 patients diagnosed with MDD and 23 HC. Both groups did not differ in age or distribution of sex (see Table ). Diagnoses in the MDD group included recurrent MDD (n = 15) and first episode MDD (n = 7). Comorbid diagnoses included somatic symptom disorder (n = 2), anxiety disorders (n = 2) and personality disorders (n = 2). 60% of the patients were treated with psychotherapy and 58% were treated with antidepressant medication (see Table ). All participants completed the TSST and SECPT separately on two different days with random assignments of order and the completion of EMA in the time between the measurements. On average, the stress paradigms were assessed with two weeks between the appointments. Procedures TSST. We used the TSST paradigm as described in our previous publications . Prior to a 7-min resting-state measurement, questionnaires and an initial stress rating on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, 0-100%) were completed. Following the resting-state measurement, state rumination during the measurement was assessed and a first salivary sample was collected. Then, participants completed two control tasks and a stress rating after each task. The first task consisted of six trials reading numbers for 40 s, followed by a 20 s pause. In the second control task with analogue time course, they had to subtract elements in steps of 13 given different starting points without time pressure or social stress. Then, two experimenters wearing white coats and remaining unresponsive to social signals entered the room, taking a seat and instructing the participant to prepare for a 5-min job interview talking about their personal strengths and qualifications. Subjects were instructed that they would be videotaped for later analysis of their behavior. The interview was followed by an arithmetic task as in the previous control task, but with different starting points and the instruction to be as fast and as correct as possible. Further, participants Table 1 Demographic and basic variables of the depressed patients (MDD) and healthy controls (HC). BDI-II=Beck Depression Inventory II , RRS = Rumination Response Scale , LSAS = Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale . had to hold eye contact with one of the experimenters. In case of an error, participants had to start all over again. After the last pause, the experimenters turned off the camera and left the room without saying a word. Then, participants gave a stress rating and salivary sample and a second 7-min resting-state measurement was performed. Afterwards, state rumination was assessed with qualitative and quantitative measures. Further, participants rated their stress and gave salivary samples every 15 min for four times (see Fig.  & Fig. ). SECPT. The original paradigm of the SECPT ) was adapted as follows: Prior to a 7-min resting-state measurement, several questionnaires and an initial stress rating were assessed. Then, an experimenter wearing a white coat entered the room, remaining unresponsive to social signals of the participants. He instructed the participants to immerse their right hand into either cold (0-2 • C) or warm water (18-20 • C) and informed them that they would be videotaped to later analyze their behavior. During cold trials, participants had to hold eye contact with the experimenter. The order of cold and warm trials was pseudo-randomized so that no more than two trials of the same type followed each other. We used this pseudo randomization to increase pain-related stress, as the feeling of pain decreased after more than two trials due to numbness. At the beginning of each trial, current pain and stress levels were rated, followed by the announcement of the following trial. After the 40-s immersion, participants were asked again to rate their pain and stress level during the trial. In sum, the stress induction consisted of eight cold and eight warm trials. To ensure standardized experimental conditions, we used a special apparatus, with a water pump, in the cold water bucket. After the last trial, the experimenter turned off the camera and left the room without saying a word. Then, the participants rated their subjective stress on the VAS and a second 7-min resting-state measurement followed. Afterwards, participants rated their stress every 15 min for four times. EMA. To assess rumination on a day-to-day basis, participants completed a questionnaire twice a day for a total of two weeks using the PsyAssesor researcher edition V2, 2019 (Machine Learning Solutions, Luxembourg). First, participants rated their subjective stress regarding the last 5 h and in how far this stress was caused by a specific event on a slider (0% = not at all; 100% = very much), with the opportunity to report events in a free text afterwards. Further, it was assessed whether regulation strategies were used to cope and how effective the coping was . Then, participants rated their agreement concerning three items assessing self-efficacy. To assess rumination-based thinking-styles, we selected items of the Perseverative Cognitions Questionnaire (PCQ) and items of the Ruminative Response Scale . Lastly, participants rated their mood and arousal on a circumplex item. Data of one patient of the final sample was excluded as only two data entries were made in the momentary assessment due to technical problems. On average 25 EMA measurements (28 were maximally possible) were recorded per participant. Cortisol. Saliva was collected using salivettes (Sarsted AG & Co, REF 51.1534.500) and stored at − 20 • C. Afterwards, salivettes were centrifuged for 2 min at 1000 g before analysis was performed with enzyme immunoassay (IBL International, Cortisol ELISA, REF RE52611) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurements took place during the whole day for reasons of scheduling. As individual cortisol levels are influenced by circadian rhythms, we regressed the effect of daytime out of the cortisol data and used the corrected data. Heart rate. Heart rate was assessed with a one channel electrocardiogram. For this procedure, two standard Ag/AgCl ring electrodes of 8 mm diameter were attached using a conductive EEG paste to the disinfected skin above the right collarbone and below the left costal arch. Another ring electrode was placed on the neck as reference. The signal was recorded using the BrainAmp ExG amplifier and Brain Vision Recorder software (Brain Products, Munich, Germany). The sampling rate of the signal was 1000 Hz. Data was preprocessed and analyzed using Brain Vision Analyzer 2.1 and MATLAB 2017a. Preprocessing included band-pass filtering (1-45 Hz). The data of one subject was highly contaminated by power line artifacts. Hence, an additional 50 Hz notch filter was applied. Thereafter, we calculated the mean interval between subsequent R-peaks for each recorded condition in beats per minute. fNIRS. We used the same probeset placement as in  with two frontal and one parietal probeset covering the following regions of interest (ROI): bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and superior parietal lobule (SPL). Optodes (18 emitter, 15 receiver) were inserted into electrode caps (easycap) with 3 cm inter-optode distance and adjusted to electrode positions Fpz and Cz according to the 10-20-system . Optode holders were enforced by sponge rings to gain more stability. We used a continuous-wave, multi-channel NIRS system (ETG-4000 Optical Topography System; Hitachi Medical Co., Japan) with a temporal resolution of 10 Hz. The system uses a semiconductor laser and avalanche diodes at two wavelengths (695±20 and 830±20 nm) with 2.0 ± 0.4 mW for each wavelength at each optode. fNIRS data was preprocessed with MATLAB 2017a. Oxygenated (O2Hb) and deoxygenated blood levels (HHb) were computed by means of a modified Beer-Lambert Law. In total, 46 channels were assessed. From these, 3 channels were selected in each case to assess the DLPFC and IFG and to measure the SPL (see supplementary figure ). Preprocessing of the data included: Correction for high amplitude movement artifacts by the TDDR correction , bandpass filtering (0.01-0.1 Hz), correlation-based signal improvement of O2Hb with HHb data , interpolation of single artefact-laden channels after visual inspection, reduction of the global signal by a PCA-based gaussian kernel filter  and z-standardization of the signal. Note that in the following O2Hb data refers to the correlation-based improved O2Hb signal. Data was then averaged for each condition with a 5 s baseline correction for the 40 s time window of task completion within each ROI. As HHb data often seems to be less sensitive but more robust than O2Hb data, we performed an additional reanalysis of the data with HHb levels (in this case, the correlation-based signal improvement was not performed in the preprocessing). We report the additional information on HHb data in parenthesis but interpret mainly O2Hb. Note that the main results of our analysis were consistent between O2Hb and HHb data; therefore, HHb data is not outlined in the text in detail to reduce redundancy. Data analysis We conducted repeated measurement ANOVAs for the analysis of behavioral data (stress ratings, state rumination, negative affect) during the TSST and SECPT with group (MDD vs. HC) as between-subjects factor, and experimental condition as within-subjects factor. For manipulation checks on whether the stress induction was successful, we additionally analyzed salivary cortisol and heart rate activity during the paradigms. fNIRS data during the paradigms was analyzed with repeated measurement ANOVAs with the between-subjects factor group (MDD vs. HC), and the experimental condition as well as ROI (bilateral IFG, bilateral DLPFC, SPL) as within-subjects factors. We validated the behavioral effects of the TSST on the induction of state rumination with daily rumination as assessed with ecological momentary assessment. To this end, we correlated mean pre-and poststress rumination as well as changes in rumination (post-pre) with EMA measurements of rumination via Pearson correlations. With respect to EMA measurements, we investigated mean rumination scores as well as standard deviations of individual EMA rumination measurements. We used standard deviations per subject as measurements of individual reactivity in daily rumination: Subjects with higher daily rumination fluctuation should show higher standard deviations in daily rumination. Further, independent raters assigned the participants' open answer format on the reason of their stress experience to 6 categories: no answer, social interaction (e.g. argument), work (e.g. deadlines), private obligation (e.g. appointments), daily hassles (e.g. organization of the day), personal reasons/internal reasons (e.g. thoughts) and political events/daily events. Finally, we investigated whether pre-and post-stress rumination during the TSST could be predicted by O2Hb levels during the TSST (control-task 1 and arithmetic task) in a multilevel model. To this end, we conducted multilevel models with pre-and post-stress state rumination as outcomes, group (MDD vs. HC), time (pre-vs. post-stress) and O2Hb levels (pre-stress control task 1, post-stress arithmetic task) in the different ROI and random intercepts. In our basic model, we aimed to replicate the results of the repeated measurement ANOVA, showing the effect of group and time on state rumination. Secondary, we used the O2Hb data as predictors for state rumination. In the models, state rumination (pre vs. post) and O2Hb levels were treated as continuous variables: pre-stress state rumination was predicted by O2Hb levels during TSST control task 1 and post-stress rumination was regressed on O2Hb levels during the TSST arithmetic task. In this way, we checked for baseline associations between state rumination and cortical oxygenation as well as stress-induced associations. Finally, we included group as well O2Hb data in the models. In case of significant effects of O2Hb data, we checked for mediation effects by Sobels z-test. Reported effect sizes represent Cohen's d, dz, and partial eta 2 . Effect size d for repeated measures was computed as described in   as d = t c [ 2(1− r) n ]1 2  and . dz = t ̅̅ n √ ( A sensitivity power analysis using G*Power 3.1.9.2 showed that we could detect effects up to f = .13 for state rumination (α = 0.05, 1-β = 0.80, N = 45, groups = 2, measurements = 2, r = 0.8, ε = 1), f = 0.12 for a within-between subject interaction in the fNIRS-TSST (α = 0.05, 1-β = 0.80, N = 45, groups = 2, measurements = 15, r = 0.5, ε = 1), f = 0.13 for fNIRS-SECPT (α = 0.05, 1-β = 0.80, N = 45, groups = 2, measurements = 10, r = 0.5, ε = 1) and correlational associations up to |ρ| = 0.39 (α = 0.05, 1-β = 0.80, N = 45). Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 27 and R (R Core Team, 2013) using the packages lme4 , lmerTest  and ggplot2 .  ). To further describe this effect, we performed additional repeated t-tests and corrected those by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure: heart rate increased from rest 1 to CTL1 (t(43) = 11.858, p < .001, dz = 1.78, d = 0.94), from CTL1 to CTL2 (t(43) = 2.360, p < .05, dz = 0.36, d = 0.15), decreased from CTL2 to anticipation (t(43) = 2.969, p < .01, dz = 0.44, d = 0.34), increased from anticipation to the TSST interview (t(42) = 7.841, p < .001, dz = 1.2, d = 0.68) and decreased again from TSST arithmetic task to rest 2 (t(42) = 12.832, p < .001, dz = 1.97, d = 1.39). Results Peripheral The analysis of heart rate during the SECPT indicated a significant main effect of condition (rest 1 vs. warm water vs. cold water vs. rest 2) (F(3, 123) = 6.475, p < .001, η 2 p = 0.14) and group (F(1, 41) = 9.028, p < .01, η 2 p = 0.18). The main effect of group was characterized by generally increased heart rates in the MDD group in comparison to the HC group. The main effect of condition was characterized by a quadratic relationship (F(1, 41) = 83.512, p < .001, η 2 p = 0.67) displaying an increase in heart rate from rest 1 to the SECPT conditions (cold and warm water) and a decrease at rest 2 (see Fig. ). The analysis of salivary cortisol samples revealed significant in- During the TSST 56% of the subjects had an increase higher than 2.5 nm/l and 66% had an increase higher than 1.25 nm/l. In contrast, during the SECPT 38% of the sample had a cortisol increase higher than 2.5 nm/l and 51% higher than 1.25 nm/l and can thus be considered responders . Behavioral Subjective stress. Analysis of subjectively rated stress during the TSST showed a main effect of group (F(1, 43) = 19.562, p < .001, η 2 p = 0.31) reflecting higher overall stress in the MDD group as compared to the HC (see Fig. ). A significant main effect of condition was observed (F(8, 344) = 58.524, p < .001, η 2 p = 0.58) (see Fig. ). Post-hoc analyses revealed increases in subjective stress from CTL1 to CTL2 (t(44) = 6.281, p < .001, dz = 0.94, d = 0.70), from CTL2 to post TSST (t(44) = 7.358, p < .001, dz = 1.10, d = 1.02) and decreases for all follow-up measures (all p < .05, dz > 0.42, d > 0.17). In  EMA data group differences and validation of TSST-associated rumination with daily reported rumination Both groups differed significantly in the EMA assessed variables (F(6, 37) = 17.914, Wilk's λ = 0.256, p < .001, η 2 p = 0.74). Post-hoc analysis indicated that the MDD group showed higher daily reported stress (F (1,42) = 16.727, p < .001, η 2 p = 0.29), lower self-efficacy (F(1,42) = 51.749, p < .001, η 2 p = 0.55), higher rumination (F(1,42) = 83.519, p < .001, η 2 p = 0.67) and higher negative affect (F(1, 42) = 42.348, p < .001, η 2 p = 0.52). High levels of daily rumination were associated with high stress (r = 0.67, p < .001), reduced self-efficacy with respect to coping with the stressful event (r = − 0.70, p < .001) and increased negative affect (r = − 0.78, p < .001) (see supplementary table 2). With respect to the open answer format for stress eliciting events, the MDD group reported more often stressful events (U = 390.5, Z = − 3.123, p < .01), more often social interactions as stress triggers (U = 125.5, Z = − 2.907, p < .01) and more often personal/internal triggers (U = 159.5, Z = − 2.125, p < .05) (see Fig. ). Finally, we validated the induction of rumination during the experimental designs with daily rumination reactions as assessed with EMA. We correlated mean rumination before and after as well as increases in state rumination through the experimental designs with mean reported ruminations in EMA as well as standard deviations in daily rumination as a measure of rumination reactivity. Our results showed that state rumination during the TSST and SECPT were highly correlated with the average daily ruminations. However, most importantly, TSST-induced rumination correlated strongly (r(44) = 0.55, p < .001) with the within-subject standard deviation of daily ruminations, showing that the reactivity in rumination during the TSST is strongly associated with daily reactivity in rumination. Note that this correlation remained significant when the data was separated according to group in the MDD group (r(21) = 0.48, p < .05) but not in the HC group (r(22) = -0.07, p > .1), and both correlation coefficients differed marginally significantly (z = 1.851, p < .1) , indicating that the correlation of TSST-related rumination increase and everyday rumination reactivity in the whole sample was driven by the MDD group. No such correlation was found for rumination increases through the SECPT and daily rumination emphasizing the discriminative validity (see Table /Fig. ). fNIRS. fNIRS data of the TSST was analyzed with a mixed repeatedmeasurements ANOVA with the within-subject factors condition (control task 1, control task 2, arithmetic task) and ROI (left IFG, right IFG, left DLPFC, right DLPFC, SPL) and the between-subject factor group (MDD vs. HC). Results revealed a significant main effect of group (O2Hb:  . Note that only the three triggers significantly differing in their occurrence between the groups were depicted. No events = average number of reporting no stressful event per subject, interactions = average number of social interactions that led to stress per subject, internal = average number of internal events (e.g. thoughts, emotions) that led to the experience of stress per subject.    Exploratory analysis Lastly, we explored the association between brain activity during the TSST and post-stress rumination by fitting multilevel models. The basic model showed, as expected, a main effect of time -reflecting increases from pre-to post-stress rumination -a main effect of group -indicating higher state rumination in the MDD group -and an interaction of group by time, showing higher reactivity (in terms of stronger increases in state rumination from pre-to post-stress) in the MDD group than in the HC group (see Table ). In our second model, we observed an interaction of O2Hb values and time for all prefrontal regions of interest, except for the SPL. The interaction indicated a negative association between O2Hb values during the arithmetic task and post-stress rumination. In contrast, pre-stress rumination was not associated with O2Hb values during control task 1 (non-stressful number reading) (see Table  and supplementary figure ). This pattern was replicated using the HHb data (see supplementary table 4), although the time by HHb-level interaction was only significant for the left DLPFC and right IFG and marginally significant in the right DLPFC and left IFG. In our final model, we included the group factor in the analysis, as hypoactivation in the prefrontal cortex and higher state rumination could both be explained by differences in the diagnostic groups. The interaction between time and O2Hb values remained significant in the left DLPFC and marginally significant in the left IFG, when group was introduced as a predictor, indicating that the association between prefrontal hypoactivity during the TSST and subsequent rumination was independent of group membership (see Table ). Using HHb data, again the interaction of time and left DLPFC remained significant. Further, the right IFG showed a significant interaction with time (see supplementary table ). Finally, we checked for potential mediations of the group differences in post-stress rumination (MDD vs. HC) by fNIRS hypoactivation during the TSST in the left DLPFC. As expected from the previous multilevel model, our results showed that the influence of group membership on post-stress rumination scores (c: B = 1.630 (0.193), p < .001, R 2 = 0.62) was partly mediated by the reduced O2Hb levels during the TSST arithmetic task in the left DLPFC (a: B = − 1.630 (0.193), p < .001, R 2 = 0.62; b: B = − 1.105 (0.292), p < .001, R 2 = 0.25; Z = 1.969 (0.173), p < .05). With respect to HHb levels, this mediation proved to be only marginally significant in the left DLPFC (a: B = − 0.24 (0.121), p < .1, R 2 = 0.08; b: B = 1.01 (0.348), p < .01, R 2 = 0.16; Z = 1.63, p < .1). However, for HHb data the mediation was observed in the right IFG (a: B = − 0.46 (0.158), p < .01, R 2 = 0.16; b: B = 0.717 (0.255), p < .01, R 2 = 0.16; Z = 2.02, p < .05). Discussion The aim of the current study was to replicate and extend our previous findings on stress-related induction of rumination. To this end, we investigated behavioral and neural reactions to psychosocial and physiological stress as well as daily rumination in patients with MDD and healthy controls. As expected, we observed increases in subjectively rated stress and physiological stress during the TSST and SECPT. However, increases in state rumination and negative affect following the stress induction procedures were only observed following the TSST, despite strong subjective stress, and high cortisol reactions as well as pain in the SECPT (see supplementary table 1). Rumination reactivity during the TSST but not SECPT was highly correlated with daily measured rumination. We observed an expected pattern of linear O2Hb increases in the CCN during the TSST  and hypoactivity in MDD patients as compared to HC. Finally, we were able to show that hypoactivity during the TSST arithmetic task in the bilateral DLPFC and IFG were significant negatively associated with post-stress rumination, but not activity during control task 1 with pre-stress rumination. In the left DLPFC this association was even stable when controlling for differences between the diagnostic groups. In a final mediation test, we showed that the group differences between MDD and HC in post-stress rumination were partly mediated by hypoactivity in the left DLPFC during the TSST arithmetic task. Previous investigations already showed that the TSST is able to induce rumination . The results of increased state rumination in the depressed subjects but not healthy controls following the TSST are very well in line with our previous investigation in high and low trait ruminators . Moreover, in the current study, we showed that this elevated reactivity in state rumination is specific to the TSST, as we did not observe such changes following the SECPT. In both tasks, the interviewers were emotionally non-responsive and subjects were videotaped during the task. We assume that the rumination-elevating nature of the TSST in depressed subjects is due to specific features of the task. During the TSST subjects perform tasks that encourage internal attributional styles. Mistakes and failures might most probably be attributed to the lack of competence during the TSST. Such attributions may trigger strong emotional reactions thatcombined with relevant pathological schemata in subject with MDDlead to the secondary emotional drive (e.g. feelings of failure, worthlessness, shame, guilt) that foster depressive rumination. This assumption is further fostered by the behavioral data on affective changes during the paradigms. Following the TSST but not the SECPT negative affect increased, despite the high pain ratings during the SECPT. In the same way, the TSST but not SECPT induced rumination that was highly correlated with everyday fluctuations in daily rumination. This result is highly encouraging in terms of using the TSST as a new standard approach to investigate depressive rumination. From naturalistic studies using EMA it is already known that stress-related rumination predicts and even mediates increases in depressive symptoms and negative affect . Despite the highly artificial situation during the TSSTwhich is obviously very different from everyday situationsthe triggered ruminative responses seem to be comparable to those in daily life. It may be expected that high trait ruminators and depressed subjects often encounter situations in everyday life that elicit similar emotional and cognitive processes as in the TSST. Such emotional content (shame, self-doubt, anger) is often reported by depressed patients. Interestingly, although 60% of the study sample was receiving psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy at the time of testing, the TSST-related state rumination response was highly significant. In future investigations and treatment protocols for depressive rumination, TSST-like situations might be used as exposure-like psychotherapeutic elements to overcome depressive rumination. Support for social reasons as triggers of daily rumination comes from the EMA reported triggers of daily stress. Depressed subjects reported social interactions as triggers for daily stress significantly more often than healthy controls. On a neural level, we observed a well-known pattern of hypoactivation in the bilateral DLPFC and IFG in the MDD group. Previous investigations already showed that MDD is characterized by hypoactivity in the prefrontal areas during cognitive tasks . Normally, stress induction paradigms are characterized by increased activity in the CCN in fNIRS and fMRI studies . In our previous investigation we observed reduced brain activity in the right IFG and DLPFC in high vs. low trait ruminators during the TSST arithmetic challenge but not during the first control task. Note that trends towards hypoactivation in this previous study were also observed in the left DLPFC and IFG. However, the current investigation yielded a main effect of group reflecting reduced O2Hb levels over the CCN regardless of the TSST condition. Notably, descriptive increases in group differences were observed with increasing stress and the multilevel modelling indicated an association of post-stress rumination with O2Hb levels during the TSST arithmetic challenge, but not between pre-stress rumination and O2Hb levels during the non-stressful number reading task. One explanation for the absence of a group by condition effect in O2Hb levels could be the already high stress and rumination levels of the MDD group at the beginning of the experiment. In the previous investigation  the high stress condition of the TSST might have been needed to elicit prefrontal dysfunctioning, while the MDD group investigated in the current study already showed these deficits before stress induction. Interestingly, following this interpretation of the cross-sectional data, one could hypothesize that the subjects might have developed this frontal dysfunctioning over time and were once in their developmental history comparable to the high trait ruminators of our previous investigation. Of course, longitudinal studies are needed to provide more robust evidence for this suggestion. Interestingly, our multilevel models suggest that activity in the left DLPFC during the TSST predicts post-stress rumination regardless of the differences between the MDD and HC group. A following test for mediation further showed evidence of a partial mediation of the group differences in post-stress rumination by left DLPFC activity during the TSST arithmetic task. Interestingly, our results are supported by a pilot study of De Witte et al. ( ) who used iTBS over the left DLPFC in 38 healthy volunteers following the TSST . Although this study is limited in its sample size and investigated participant group (healthy controls), the authors observed a marginally significant interaction of trait-rumination and stimulation: While high trait ruminators showed a tendency towards higher state rumination after stress when they were treated with a sham iTBS intervention, high trait ruminators that were treated with an (excitatory) iTBS protocol showed no stress-induced increase in state rumination. In the same way, inhibition and excitation of the DLPFC has been shown to influence impulsive behavior and forgiveness . These results further emphasize the potential for neurointerventional methods in the CCN . Prefrontal dysfunction in depression and anxiety has been observed in various investigations . The potential overlapping feature in both kinds of diseases might be the prolonged exposure to stress whichmediated by rumination  leads to allostatic changes in prefrontal functioning . These allostatic changes in prefrontal functioning might then be seen as a risk factor that mediates the cognitive-emotional response to future stress situations. In line with this suggestion, previous investigations have shown that stress is associated with decreased executive control and diminished emotion regulation in MDD . Despite the mostly conclusive findings of this study, some important limitations must be addressed. In the current investigation we used the method of functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The method has some important advantages such as the usability in ecologically valid environments. It allowed the investigation of cortical oxygenation during the TSST, which is the gold standard in the investigation of the neurobiology of stress induction . However, this comes at the cost of a limited spatial-and depth-resolution as fNIRS only allows to measure the upper layer of the cortex . Our fNIRS system did not include short distance channels, which would allow further separation of physiological noise. Further, the investigated sample is limited in terms of power for a fine-grained investigation of brain-areas affected in MDD during the TSST or more complex multi-level modelling. Additionally, the cross-sectional design only allows for hypothetical statements about developmental factors of hypoactivity in MDD as well as potential effects of psychotherapeutic treatment and medication. We did not investigate the role of treatment factors in greater detail as the sample size was limited and the patients were at different stages of therapy. Finally, we did not use a randomization of the control and stress conditions during the TSST to prevent carry-over effects when measuring the control conditions after the TSST. However, we assume that the reported effects of this study are not influenced by effects of ordering in a substantial way (e.g. that the TSST would not be stressful, if the control condition was not carried out first). Potential designs controlling for potential sequential effects during the TSST would be very cost effective and would not add much to the understanding of the research questions raised in this paper. To our knowledge, this is the first study that validated a laboratory rumination induction paradigm with respect to external everyday rumination. Given the high importance of rumination in the development and maintenance of depression, other rumination paradigms should be validated in the same way. The study at hand gives clear evidence that the TSST induces state rumination increases in MDD subjects that are associated with daily life rumination reactivity. The neural correlates of the stress-induced increases in state rumination involve prefrontal hypoactivity in areas of the CCN. Future investigations should focus on the role of prefrontal dysfunctioning in triggered depressive rumination. First interventional studies provide good evidence for being optimistic. Further, it is important to investigate in how far this stress-related prefrontal hypoactivity in MDD is reversible through psychotherapeutic intervention. Significance statement The results of our study are in line with our hypotheses that the effects were specific to the psychosocial component in the TSST, as the effects were absent in the SECPT. Thereby, hypoactivity in the cognitive control network during the TSST mediated the increases in rumination in the MDD subjects. While the TSST is a highly artificial situation, it seems to induce rumination similar to daily stressors. Prefrontal hypoactivity in response to stress seems to mediate the development of affectdriven rumination in MDD subjects. These effects are specific to social interactions and can be differentiated from physiological stress. These results inform the practitioner on the nature of depressive rumination as well as potential targets of psychotherapeutic treatment and neurostimulation.

17,17,The theory of planned behaviour and sleep opportunity: An ecological momentary assessment,"Insufficient sleep is common among American adolescents , college students  adults (Liu et al.,   2016), which is highly significant due to sleep's robust associations with health outcomes . However, the source of the USA sleep deficit is not entirely understood. It is estimated that 10% of adults in the USA have a clinical sleep disorder (Ram et al., 2010), and 7.7% of college students have insomnia (Schlarb et al., 2012), demonstrating that many individuals may be choosing to restrict their sleep. Whereas sleep duration is influenced by a broad range of behavioural, environmental, and physiological factors (Irish et al., 2015; Klerman & Dijk, 2005), the amount of time allowed for sleep at night (i.e. sleep opportunity) is more directly within behavioural control, and therefore represents an important target for sleep health promotion efforts. It is not well understood why or how individuals make decisions about establishing healthy sleep opportunities. The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) offers an established theoretical framework to study sleep opportunity.

","[""interoception"", ""heartbeat perception"", ""EMA""]",10.3390/ijerph18094893,"Introduction Interoception can be described as the ability to sense one's own physiological condition of the body . While some researchers referred to interoception as a single construct , others examined different facets of interoception . These inconsistent terminologies and their use have been criticized by Garfinkel et al. , who demanded consistent and clear definitions. By examining the structure of interoception, Garfinkel, Seth, Barrett, Suzuki and Critchley  showed that interoception is a multi-facetted phenomenon including (at least) interoceptive accuracy, awareness and sensibility. Interoceptive sensibility can be described as the self-evaluation of someone's subjective interoception assessed by using self-reports . Interoceptive accuracy describes someone's actual performance in an objective interoceptive task, e.g., a heartbeat perception task, whereas interoceptive awareness comprises the metacognitive awareness of one's own interoceptive accuracy. Garfinkel, Seth, Barrett, Suzuki and Critchley  showed that interoceptive awareness and sensibility could only partly predict interoceptive accuracy. All three dimensions were distinct and separable. Since there was a relationship between the facets, but only within the group of individuals with the greatest interoceptive accuracy, interoceptive accuracy has been highlighted as the core construct of interoception. The authors suggested that the relationship between the interoceptive facets is stronger for individuals with high interoceptive accuracy compared to those with low interoceptive accuracy. In a pilot study of 24 healthy students, Meessen et al. , in fact, demonstrated that all three facets of interoception are uncorrelated. Forkmann et al.  confirmed the 2 of 20 three-dimensionality of interoception by reporting no correlations between the facets when accuracy was measured with the heartbeat perception task  and moderate correlations when accuracy was measured with the heartbeat discrimination task. Research suggests that the facets of interoception seem to be associated with psychological distress, e.g., depression and anxiety . For anxiety, mixed results have been reported . While Garfinkel et al.  and Dunn et al.  found that interoceptive accuracy independently contributed to anxiety symptoms, other studies state that patients with panic disorder show similar or even better interoceptive accuracy  but worse interoceptive sensibility  compared to a control group. Interoceptive awareness was positively related to trait anxiety . For depression, deficits in interoceptive accuracy generally seem to be associated with depressive symptoms . A review by Eggart et al.  suggested a u-shaped relationship between depression and interoceptive accuracy, with largest interoceptive deficits coinciding with moderate depression severity. Only recently, it has been proposed that interoceptive deficits might also be related to suicidal ideation and behavior . Interoceptive sensibility measured with the selfreport measure Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA)  and assessed with the subscale ""interoceptive deficits"" from the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI-3)  was negatively associated with current suicidal ideation and past suicide attempts . MAIA scores could differentiate between suicide attempters, suicidal ideators and a control group . The EDI even differentiated recent and distant suicide attempters . There are only two studies available so far that investigated interoceptive accuracy (i.e., the objective performance in detecting body sensations) in relation to suicidal ideation or behavior. Results showed no differences in interoceptive accuracy (but in interoceptive sensibility) for participants with compared to those without suicidal ideation  and lower heartbeat perception accuracy in suicide attempters compared to non-attempters . However, there has been no study investigating associations between interoceptive awareness and suicidality . Regarding the assessment of interoceptive sensibility, there are two critical points: on the one hand, many studies assessed interoceptive sensibility with a subscale of the EDI , which was originally developed for participants with eating disorders and assesses interoception in relation to food intake and the gastrointestinal system . Thus, it appears at least questionable whether conclusions based on EDI-data can be generalized to patients with no eating but other mental disorders. On the other hand, in self-report questionnaires, interoceptive sensibility was usually assessed retrospectively and the timeframe respondents are asked to refer to was not specified. For example, the MAIA refers to ""the general daily life"" , while the EDI refers to how often each statement applies with no time frame at all . It has been argued that questionnaire-based retrospective assessments are compromised by memory bias and a lack of ecological validity . It is unclear whether interoception is best understood as being state-like or trait-like. There is evidence from few studies suggesting within-person change in interoception across time. A study by Wittkamp et al.  using latent state-trait analysis of interoceptive accuracy assessments on three consecutive measurement occasions showed that 40% of variance in one single interoceptive accuracy measurement could be explained by trait, whereas 27% was traced to effects of situation and person-situation interactions-suggesting some variability in interoceptive accuracy over time. Some further evidence comes from studies that investigated whether facets of interoception could be trained. Studies showed that interoceptive awareness trained by daily practices of ""Body Scans"" and ""Breath Meditation""  and accuracy trained by daily ""Body Scans"" over eight weeks  and by contingent cardiac feedback  could be improved, suggesting that interoception can generally be affected by situational or behavioral manipulations (i.e., training), which implies a certain temporal variability. Only interoceptive sensibility appeared not to be affected by ""Body Scan"" interventions . It is unclear, however, whether the mere repeated execution of the various interoception measurements already results in a practice effect as the studies mentioned above explicitly trained the facets through interventions. It is also unclear how the facets of interoception behave over time and whether they are measurable over short time intervals of minutes or hours. A viable alternative assessment method that promises the possibility to overcome memory bias, lack of ecological validity and allows for the assessment of within-person variation across short time frames, is Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). EMA refers to the repeated sampling of subjects' current behaviors and experiences in real time and in their natural environments , for example, via smartphones . There is empirical evidence on the within-person variation and temporal trajectories of clinical variables such as suicidal ideation, depression and anxiety . Although as noted above, interoception has been shown to be related to all these clinical variables, to date, we know virtually nothing about the temporal course of the facets of interoception across short intervals of minutes or hours. While interoceptive sensibility is usually assessed via self-report, which can rather easily be adopted to the EMA-setting (such as already implemented for, e.g., suicidal ideation or negative affect ), the assessment of interoceptive accuracy and awareness is more challenging, since it requires the collection of both self-reported information and the number of heartbeats in given time-frames. Therefore, the aim of this study was to measure interoceptive accuracy, awareness and sensibility using EMA. Since the facets of interoception have never been investigated in such a study design, this study should be treated as a pilot study. The main goal of this study was to test the general feasibility of such a study design and to find out whether the facets of interoception are subject to intraindividual fluctuations. Because of the novelty of the design and potential test burden associated with repeated EMA, we abstained from including patients with mental disorders but decided to aim for a non-clinical sample to prove the study concept. Based on prior findings on interoception, we hypothesized that (a) all three facets of interoception fluctuate over time. Additionally, we hypothesized that (b) there will be no practice effect for the facets of interoception through mere interoceptive task repetition, since positive practice effects have only been shown for targeted interventions and not solely for mere task repetition. Materials and Methods Participants The final sample consisted of n = 61 participants aged between 18 and 51 years (M = 24.21, SD = 6.99). Participants were eligible if they were at least 18 years old, had sufficient knowledge of the German language, had no current mental disorder and did not abuse drugs or alcohol. In order to keep the study comparable to other studies assessing interoception , participants needed to be physically healthy and showing a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 24, since it has been shown that obesity affects the ability to detect feedback of cardiovascular functions and, thereby, influences an individual's interoceptive abilities . Additionally, they should neither take medication influencing the cardiovascular system nor participate in competitive or endurance sports more than three times a week. Fifty-four participants were female (88.5%). Most participants were unmarried (n = 57; 93.4%) and working (n = 39; 63.9%). Only ten participants lived alone (16.4%). Twenty participants (32.8%) reported a mental disorder in their past, assessed with the short version of the diagnostic interview for mental disorders (Mini-DIPS) . Three participants (4.9%) reported a suicide attempt in their lifetime. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups (interoception vs. control group). The randomization was conducted with www.randomizer.org, accessed on 26 March 2021 by generating a random order of the numbers 1 and 2 (1 = interoception group, 2 = control group). Participants were assigned consecutively to these groups in the randomized order after examining the eligibility criteria. Both groups completed the same EMA with only one difference: the control group (n = 30) did not complete interoception tasks during the EMA phase of the study, while the interoception group (n = 31) was assessed for all three facets of interoception via EMA. Procedure Participants were recruited between June and December 2019 via postings in Facebook groups as well as with flyers at the University of Duisburg-Essen and other places open to the public (such as public library). Participants who were interested in participating got in touch with the study team via e-mail. The study team then contacted those possible participants for a telephone interview. The telephone interview was conducted to check in and exclusion criteria, such as sufficient knowledge of the German language, no current mental disorder, no drug or alcohol abuse and a BMI between 18.5 and 24. Since this was a pilot study and the main goal was to examine interoception in an EMA-setting, we aimed for participants without a current mental disorder to keep the test burden low. Participants were asked whether they were currently, diagnosed with a mental disorder or were receiving treatment for a mental disorder. In case of current mental disorders, participants were immediately excluded from study participation. For assessing the BMI, participants were asked for their height and their weight. Then, the BMI was calculated. If the BMI was below 18.5 or over 24, participants were excluded from the study. When participants met the eligibility criteria, they were invited to our lab. Prior to the assessments, participants were informed about the purpose of the study, the voluntary nature of their participation, data storage and security. They gave written informed consent before participating. The study was approved by the responsible Ethic Committee of the University of Duisburg-Essen and was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki . For their participation, participants received 60 EUR or five hours of study credit and 10 EUR. Participants' recruitment first included a telephone interview. The study included three main assessments (baseline, EMA, post), which are described in detail in the following. Baseline Assessment Participants underwent a baseline assessment (T0) in our lab including a structured clinical interview (Mini-DIPS)  on mental disorders to verify the participants' report in the prior telephone interview that they were currently not suffering from a mental disorder. The Mini-DIPS was conducted by researchers who had at least a Bachelor Degree in psychology and were familiar with the ICD-10 classification system of mental diseases . Additionally, those researchers had received a training in conducting the Mini-DIPS prior to the start of this study. In case a current mental disorder was diagnosed, participants were excluded right away and were informed about the diagnoses and treatment options at the outpatient clinic for mental health at the local university and additional contacts to get help. All participants without a current mental disorder and/or a mental disorder in the past filled out questionnaires. Additionally, they conducted a heartbeat perception task (pre-HPT) in our lab to assess participants' interoceptive accuracy and awareness. If they reported drug use in the sociodemographic questionnaire, which they had not mentioned before, they were excluded (see Figure ). 7-Day EMA After the baseline assessment, participants were introduced to the EMA method (i.e., overview of the app, charging the phone, carrying the phone at all times). They received an android study smartphone, used for data collection via the app movisensXS, v1.4.8 (movisens GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) The study smartphone could only be used for this app; all other applications were blocked. Participants in the interoception group were additionally equipped with a wearable smartwatch (Polar A370; Polar Electro GmbH, Büttelborn, Germany) and were instructed to wear the smartwatch from 8 am to 8 pm for seven days. Additionally, they were reminded to do so every morning via the app movisensXS. Participants then underwent a seven-day EMA with five assessments per day outside of the lab, resulting in a maximum of 35 assessments per participant. These five assessments per day were randomly presented between 8 am and 8 pm with at least two hours between two measurements. A short beep announced the beginning of an assessment. Assessments were randomized in the time of their occurrence throughout the day. Participants could postpone (15 min) or completely reject a prompt if they were not able to answer. In case the phone battery ran below 20%, participants received a notification to charge the phone. Since the single assessments were short, the overall time of assessments was <30 min per day. Individual results were uploaded from the smartphone to a webserver via mobile data directly after completion of each assessment, allowing the research team to check compliance rates. Each participant received three text messages for motivational purposes or in case their compliance rate dropped below 80% during the course of the entire EMA phase. All participants received the same assessments and where prompted 5 times per day for 7 days. Participants in the control group answered 20 items including several constructs such as mood, context and suicidal ideation. For participants in the interoception group, each assessment additionally included 8 items assessing interoceptive sensibility and an EMA-HPT. Interoception items and the EMA-HPT task were designed specifically for this study by the authors and the movisensXS support team. Participants in the interoception group were instructed not to perform excessive activities before or during the single assessments. All participants were provided with information of a German helpline and also had the possibility to contact the study staff through the messenger option within the app in case of technical questions or in case they felt burdened. Messages were checked at a regular daily basis. No participant reported to feel burdened through the assessments.  7-Day EMA After the baseline assessment, participants were introduced to the EMA method (i.e., overview of the app, charging the phone, carrying the phone at all times). They received an android study smartphone, used for data collection via the app movisensXS, v1.4.8 (movisens GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) The study smartphone could only be used for this app; all other applications were blocked. Participants in the interoception group were additionally equipped with a wearable smartwatch (Polar A370; Polar Electro GmbH, Büttelborn, Germany) and were instructed to wear the smartwatch from 8 am to 8 pm for seven days. Additionally, they were reminded to do so every morning via the app mo-visensXS. Participants then underwent a seven-day EMA with five assessments per day outside of the lab, resulting in a maximum of 35 assessments per participant. These five assessments per day were randomly presented between 8 am and 8 pm with at least two hours between two measurements. A short beep announced the beginning of an assessment. Assessments were randomized in the time of their occurrence throughout the day. Participants could postpone (15 min) or completely reject a prompt if they were not able to answer. In case the phone battery ran below 20%, participants received a notification to charge the phone. Since the single assessments were short, the overall time of assessments was <30 min per day. Individual results were uploaded from the smartphone to a webserver via mobile data directly after completion of each assessment, allowing the research team to check compliance rates. Each participant received three text messages for motivational purposes or in case their compliance rate dropped below 80% during the course of  Post Assessment After the EMA phase, participants were invited to a post assessment inclusively returning the study smartphone and the smartwatch. Participants had to participate in the post assessment within the latest of 14 days after the EMA phase. The post assessment (T2) took place in the same lab as T0 and was identical to the baseline assessment except for the Mini-DIPS and the sociodemographic questionnaire, which were excluded in the post assessment. Participants received several questionnaires and conducted the post-HPT. Figure  provides an overview of the procedure. Measures Measures relevant for the aims of the present study will be described in detail. Further information on the other measures can be found elsewhere . Baseline and Post Assessment Measures Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) The questionnaire contains 32 items rated on a six-point scale ranging from ""never"" (0) to ""always"" (5) including eight subscales. Mean subscale scores are calculated for the subscales Noticing, Not-Distracting, Not-Worrying, Attention Regulation, Emotional Awareness, Self-Regulation, Body Listening and Trusting. Higher scores indicate higher interoceptive sensibility. Internal consistencies (Cronbach's α) at T0 for the single scales varied between 0.55 and 0.89, Cronbach's α at T2 varied between 0.64 and 0.93. The MAIA was applied before and after the EMA phase resulting in pre-and post-data . Pre-and Post-Heartbeat Perception Task (HPT) For the heartbeat perception task, participants were seated in our lab and provided with electrodes. The actual heart rate was recorded via electrocardiogram (ECG) using a BIOPAC MP150 (Biopac, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). Participants were instructed to sit quietly during the entire experiment. First, a five minute baseline was conducted. Then, participants received the instruction of the heartbeat perception task on a computer screen. The heartbeat perception task was programmed with Presentation ® software v18.0 (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Berkeley, CA, USA). In line with the Mental Tracking Method described by Schandry , participants were asked to silently count their heartbeats in randomized intervals of 25, 35 and 45 s for ten trials. The beginning and end of the counting phases were indicated by a start and a stop tone. Participants were instructed to not take their pulse or to use any manipulations enabling their counting. Additionally, participants had to enter the number of their counted heartbeats and were asked for a confidence judgement of their performance ranging from 0 to 100% (""How sure are you on a scale from 0 to 100 percent that your estimation is correct?"". There was a 60 s break between each trial. Participants did not receive any information about the length of the intervals or their performance. After five trials, participants received a break of 5 min for assessing another baseline. For the ten trials, an accuracy score (pre-and post-HPT score) was derived according to Schandry : HPS = 1 10 * ∑ 1 − |recorded heartbeats − perceived heartbeats| recorded heartbeats (1) The score indicates interoceptive accuracy and ranges from 0 to 1 with lower scores indicating poor heartbeat perception. Negative values are possible in case the number of the perceived heartbeats exceeds 200% of the recorded heartbeats . Interoceptive awareness was calculated by computing the differences between judgments of confidence and the respective HPT score. Since the HPT score ranged from 0 to 1 and the confidence judgment ranged from 0 to 100, the variable of the HPT score was transformed by multiplying the HPT score with 100. Then, we subtracted the HPT score from the awareness score. A positive value as a result of this calculation means that a person overestimates his/her own performance, a negative value indicates an underestimation of one's own performance. A value around 0 indicates a good awareness. Items Used during the EMA Phase EMA-MAIA In order to capture interoceptive sensibility entirely by use of MAIA items during EMA, factor loadings of the MAIA items from validation studies were compared . One item with the highest factor loading from each of the eight MAIA subscales  was selected, resulting in a total of eight items. Items were adapted to the moment-tomoment design by adding ""At the moment"" to the beginning of the respective item and adjusting the item wording to the moment in order to capture the real-time character and the moment-to-moment variability (e.g., Noticing: ""At this moment, I notice where in my body I am comfortable; Body Trust: At this moment I feel my body is a safe place"" (Supplementary Materials available: detailed list of all items used during EMA). All eight items had to be rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from ""not at all"" (1) to ""very strong"" (5). EMA-HPT One trial of the HPT task was used in each assessment. Participants were asked to silently count their heartbeat for a time interval lasting either 25, 35 or 45 s. The time interval was marked by two beep tones from the smartphone indicating the start and the end of the interval (""In the following task you will hear a short beep. After a while a second beep will follow. Your task is to count your heartbeat as accurately as possible in the time between the two beeps. After the second beep, click on the check mark in the upper right corner to enter the number of heartbeats you have counted.""). Then, participants were requested to enter the number of counted heartbeats in the MovisensXS app: ""Please enter the exact number of your counted heartbeats."". The task was completed with the answer of participants to how sure they were about their estimation on a scale from 0 to 100% (Confidence Judgement; ""How sure are you that the number of your counted heartbeats matches your actual heartbeats? (in percent)""). The actual heart rate of participants was recorded with the Polar A370. Polar devices have shown good validity and reliability in measuring heartrate . The Polar A370 shows a more reasonable accuracy than other Polar devices  and allows a wrist-based heart rate measurement using a technology called optical heart rate monitoring (OHR). Heartrate data were collected every second by the device. The device provides time-stamped HR data allowing matching of the data with the EMA-HPT trial after transferring the data of the Polar A370 to the Polar FlowSync desktop app v3.0.0.1337 (Polar Electro GmbH, Büttelborn, Germany). For the analyses, data of the time intervals of the EMA-HPT were extracted and time-matched. EMA-HPT scores were calculated with these heart rate measurements following the formula of Schandry  mentioned above. Interoceptive awareness during EMA was calculated as for T0 and T2. Statistical Analyses Since, to the best of our knowledge, interoception has never been assessed using smartphone-based EMA before, we will first report descriptive statistics of the three facets of interoception measured via EMA and in the laboratory at baseline and post assessment. Especially the assessment of interoceptive accuracy via EMA outside of the laboratory is a new method. We expected that baseline assessments in the laboratory and the day 1 EMA-based assessments of interoceptive accuracy should give similar results, since those assessments were conducted within short time intervals. The same applies to the last day (day 7) of EMA and the post assessment. T-tests for dependent samples were implemented to test differences in means between pre-HPT and day 1 EMA-HPT, as well as post-HPT and day 7 EMA-HPT. No differences would indicate validity of interoceptive accuracy assessed via EMA. EMA-Data (Interoception Group Only) For the analyses regarding hypothesis a), only the EMA data of the interoception group were used. The dataset consisted of 35 (assessments on level 1) × 31 (persons on level 2) = 1085 observations. On average, participants completed 79.6% of the assessments. Missing data at level 1 were handled with pairwise deletion for each correlation pair and for each beep per person. Through this pairwise deletion, it is possible to include this person for all further beeps and for all further correlation pairs. Because of the nested structure of the data, multilevel analyses using the statistical software HLM v7.03 (Scientific Software International, Inc., Chapel Hill, NC, USA) and RStudio v1.3.1093 (R Team, Boston, MA, USA) software, including the package ggplot2 , were conducted. For examining fluctuations, intercept-only models were calculated for all three facets of interoception. Variance components of these intercept-only models were used to compute intra-class correlations (ICC) as an indicator of the proportion of variance explained by the different levels . For assessing variability across time, Mean Squared Successive Differences (MSSD) were calculated. The MSSD can be described as the sum score of the squared differences between two measurements in time series and, therefore, represents point-to-point variability. Higher values indicate higher fluctuation . To illustrate those possible fluctuations of the facets of interoception, we plotted the fluctuations across all 35 assessments points for each participant and separately for each interoceptive facet. Baseline and Post Assessment Data For the second hypothesis of the study, stating that there is no practice effect for the facets of interoception through repetition of interoceptive tasks, data from the entire sample were used. Mixed factorial ANOVAs and simple ANOVAs were calculated in SPSS v26 software (IBM Deutschland GmbH, Ehningen, Germany) to reveal differences in interoceptive accuracy, awareness and sensibility (pre-HPT vs. post-HPT) between groups (control group vs. interoception group) and between assessments (baseline vs. post assessment). Results Descriptive statistics of all study variables can be found in Table . T-tests for dependent samples revealed no significant difference between mean interoceptive accuracy measured in the laboratory at T0 (pre-HPT: M = 0.59; SD = 0.09) and mean interoceptive accuracy at day 1 measured via EMA (day 1 HPT-EMA: M = 0.59; SD = 0.27; t(28) = −0.064, p = 0.95). In addition, there was no difference between mean interoceptive accuracy measured in the laboratory at T2 (post-HPT: M = 0.60, SD = 0.11) and mean interoceptive accuracy measured at day 7 via EMA (day 7 HPT-EMA: M = 0.60, SD = 0.23; t(27) = 0.138, p = 0.89). This suggests that results of EMA-based assessments of interoceptive accuracy (HPT-EMA) do not differ from assessments of interoceptive accuracy in the laboratory, supporting the validity of assessing interoceptive accuracy based on EMA outside the laboratory. Short-Term Variability of Interoception during EMA For interoceptive awareness, 37% of the variance was accounted for by within-person variability (over time, see Table ). For the EMA-HPT score (as a measure of interoceptive accuracy), ICCs indicated that 58% of variance was due to within-person variability (over time). Between 38% and 62% of variance in the MAIA subscales as a measure of interoceptive sensibility during EMA was due to within-person variability (over time), depending on the subscale. For ""Emotional Awareness"" and ""Self-Regulation"" the proportion of variance due to within-person variability was 38%, while for ""Attention Regulation"", 62% of variance was due to within-person variability. Additionally, MSSDs, as can be seen in Table , demonstrated a wide range, indicating large differences between individuals in intra-individual variability across time. For the MAIA subscales during EMA, attention regulation seemed to have the highest point-to-point variability in comparison to the other scales. Figures  show the individual trajectories of interoception during EMA for each of the facets separately over 35 assessments for the participants of the interoception group, sorted by subject ID. Practice Effects of Interoception from Baseline to Post Assessment The mixed factorial ANOVA did not show a statistically significant interaction between time (baseline assessment vs. post assessment) and group (interoception group vs. control group) for interoceptive accuracy (pre-vs. post-HPT). There was also no significant main effect for time or group. For interoceptive awareness, there was neither a statistically significant interaction between time and group nor a significant main effect for time or group (see Table ).          Within-subject effect = Time (Performance in baseline assessment and post assessment of the respective measurement); between-subject factor = Group (interoception group (n = 31) and control group (n = 30), 1 MAIA (= Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness) scales, * p < 0.05. For interoceptive sensibility results of each MAIA scale is reported separately. For four of the subscales, there were significant results. There was a significant main effect of time (F(1, 59) = 5.17, p < 0.05) for the scale ""Noticing"". Independently of group, participants improved from the baseline to the post assessment (M BaselineInteroception = 3.31, SD BaselineInteroception = 0.79, M BaselineControl = 3.26, SD BaselineControl = 0.81, M PostInteroception = 3.65, SD PostInteroception = 0.74, M PostControl = 3.39, SD PostControl = 0.68). For ""Attention Regulation"", there was a significant interaction effect of time*group (F(1, 59) = 3.96, p < 0.05). Simple ANOVAs showed that there were only significant differences between the interoception and the control group at the post assessment (F(1, 59) = 6.65, p < 0.05) but not at the baseline assessment (F(1,59) = 1.18, p = 0.28). At the post assessment, participants in the interoception group showed significantly higher scores in ""Attention Regulation"" than participants in the control group (M PostInteroception = 3.21, SD PostInteroception = 0.83, M PostControl = 2.68, SD PostControl = 0.78). In regard to ""Emotional Awareness"", there was only a significant main effect of time (F(1, 59) = 5.48, p < 0.05). Independently of group, participants improved from the baseline to the post assessment in their self-reported ""Emotional Awareness"" (M BaselineInteroception = 3.44, SD BaselineInteroception = 0.98, M BaselineControl = 3.42, SD BaselineControl = 0.91, M PostInteroception = 3.76, SD PostInteroception = 0.76, M PostControl = 3.58, SD PostControl = 0.79). In regard to ""Body Listening"", there was a significant main effect of time (F(1,59) = 4.04, p < 0.05). Independently of group, participants improved from the baseline to the post assessment in their self-reported ability to listen to their body (M BaselineInteroception = 2.76, SD BaselineInteroception = 0.99, M BaselineControl = 2.56, SD BaselineControl = 0.99, M PostInteroception = 3.18, SD PostInteroception = 0.93, M PostControl = 2.62, SD PostControl = 1.06). Discussion The aim of the current study was to assess interoception in an EMA-setting to examine its temporal course. We hypothesized that the facets of interoception fluctuate (a) and that there is no practice effect for the facets of interoception based on repetition of interoceptive tasks (b). Fluctuations of Interoception during EMA Given the current findings, the first hypothesis that interoceptive accuracy, awareness and sensibility fluctuate could be confirmed. Around 50% of the variance in all three facets of interoception was due to within-person variability. It could also be confirmed that this variability differed considerably between individuals, which complements findings of Wittkamp, Bertsch, Vögele and Schulz . The present results that interceptive accuracy, awareness and sensibility fluctuate across time are in line with results of EMA-based studies measuring clinical variables. Similar to the facets of interoception, it has been shown that depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation fluctuate across time . All these variables have been shown to be related to interoception . Thus, results of this study call for future studies investigating the longitudinal association between clinical variables such as depression or suicidal ideation and interoception across time. The high temporal resolution of EMA facilitates the identification of differential relations between clinical variables and improves the understanding of an individual patient's dynamic symptom change. Since compliance was excellent in the present study and in prior studies investigating clinical samples , future EMA-studies assessing interoception in clinical samples are warranted. Results of this study support the general feasibility of assessing interoception in EMA-studies. Practice Effects of Interoception from Baseline to Post Assessment Regarding the second hypothesis of different facets of interoception not being improved by repetitive interoceptive tasks, our findings were mixed. Most importantly, for interoceptive accuracy as well as awareness, there were no significant practice effects. At first glance, this result appears to be contrary to findings of Bornemann, Herbert, Mehling and Singer  and Fischer, Messner and Pollatos , who showed that interoceptive accuracy and awareness could be improved by training. However, their trainings contained interventions such as the daily practice of ""Body Scan"" and contingent cardiac feedback during the HPT, which were both specifically targeted at improving interoception, whereas in the present study, no specific training was applied but only the effect of repeated practice was examined. In the interoception group, only the interoception tasks were presented repeatedly compared to the control group. Participants in this study did not receive feedback and, therefore, could not notice whether they improved or not. Conclusively, interoceptive tasks, especially the HPT as a performance task, can be repeated and assessed multiple times without noticeable practice effects. Fluctuations and interindividual differences appear to be interpretable and should not be traced to practice effects only. For future studies with a similar setup, it would be interesting to examine how such highly repeated contingent cardiac feedback in short time intervals over several days would influence the interoceptive accuracy and awareness. This is especially interesting in regard to clinical practice. Interoceptive EMA interventions would allow patients to autonomously train repetitively by themselves wherever they are, which could also potentially improve their self-efficacy. In the light of recent studies, the training of interoceptive skills could have a positive impact on e.g., depression  and chronic worry  and could, therefore, be of high benefit in clinical practice. For interoceptive sensibility, the MAIA scale ""Attention Regulation"" showed significant practice effects. Participants in the interoception group showed significantly higher scores at the post assessment than participants in the control group. Since ""Attention Regulation"" seems to be improvable through practice, one could speculate whether a targeted training of ""Attention Regelation"" might have beneficial effects on mental and/or physical health. However, it is important to keep in mind that in the current study participants could have only improved in their self-reported ""Attention Regulation"" because they were forced to give more attention to themselves than usually through the repetitive EMA. Since there were also significant main effects of time for the scales ""Noticing"", ""Emotional Awareness"" and ""Body Listening"", participants also improved in those scales measuring interoceptive sensibility independently from group. Thus, improvements in interoceptive sensibility should not only be attributed to repeated assessments of interoception in EMA. Instead, only one repetition of these measurements (T0-T2) seems sufficient to increase interoceptive sensibility, at least for certain scales. However, results could be different in a clinical sample and need replication before further conclusions should be derived. Strengths and Limitations The results of the present study should be appreciated in the light of some strengths and limitations. The major strength of the study was being the first to assess the facets of interoception in EMA and, therefore, providing important findings about how the facets of interoception behave over time. Since there were no substantial practice effects for accuracy and awareness, it seems to be valid to measure the facets of interoception repeatedly. Furthermore, t-tests did not reveal differences in means between the assessments of interoceptive accuracy in EMA and at the baseline and post assessment supporting the validity of the assessment of interoceptive accuracy outside a laboratory setting. Additionally, for the baseline and post assessment in the laboratory, heartbeats were recorded via electrocardiogram (ECG) using a BIOPAC MP150. As already stated, the current study is the first to assess interoception in an EMA design. Therefore, the primary aim of the study was to show the feasibility of assessing interoception within EMA and to investigate its temporal course. Since EMA is associated with some test burden in daily life, we deliberately abstained from including participants with mental disorders. We were able to show, in this study, the principal feasibility of the assessment strategy and the temporal fluctuation of interoception. In our view, this pattern of results warrants further investigation, ideally in clinical populations. The first limitation of this study is that resting heart rate of participants was only assessed before the pre-and post-HPT at the baseline and post assessment. During the EMA phase, we did not control for arousal, which is negatively correlated with interoceptive accuracy . However, participants were familiar with the HPT task and practiced this task in our laboratory. When giving instructions to participants for the EMA phase, we explicitly reminded participants not to perform excessive activities before or during the EMA phase. We also asked participants during EMA what they had been doing before, where they were and if anything noteworthy had happened since the last assessment. There was no statistical control for context effects in the analyses of this study, since answers to these questions were heterogeneous and did not allow quantitative analyses. We did calculate the average heart beats per minute of our sample with M = 84 and SD = 10 (min. = 65, max. = 112). For future studies, one possibility could be to use bolus infusions of isoproterenol, a non-selective beta adrenergic agonist, which elicits rapid increases in heart rate and has been shown to overcome a major limitation of HPTs . Another possibility would be to instruct participants additionally at the beginning of each assessment to sit down and rest for 5 min before starting the assessment. However, compliance for such an extended approach might be low, since it would take longer for the participant. Second, the HPT  seems to be influenced by non-interoceptive processes  and interoceptive accuracy scores derived from it are potentially problematic . Even though different psychological processes such as emotion regulation capacities  and decisionmaking  have been related to interoceptive accuracy scores derived from the HPT highlighting its role in psychological research, Zamariola et al.  propose four criticisms, with which Ainley et al.  insistently disagreed arguing that three of the four criticisms are not valid (for more detailed information see: Ainley et al. ). (1) Zamariola, Maurage, Luminet and Corneille  state that interoceptive accuracy measured with the HPT depends on the error of participants' undercounting of their perceived heartbeats due to their beliefs about their heart rate. Ainley, Tsakiris, Pollatos, Schulz and Herbert  counter that participants' beliefs do not explain why participants would rate their heart rates lower than they are and, thereby, their beliefs would not particularly explain their possible undercounting, which is contradictory to the first criticism. (2) The number of recorded heartbeats and the number of perceived heartbeats does not correlate (in Zamariola, Maurage, Luminet and Corneille's data ). However, Ainley, Tsakiris, Pollatos, Schulz and Herbert  found that Zamariola, Maurage, Luminet and Corneille  made this assumption due to arithmetic misunderstanding, which disproves this second criticism. (3) Zamariola, Maurage, Luminet and Corneille  state that a measure for interoceptive accuracy should not depend on heart condition. However, this should actually be treated in favor of the HPT's construct validity, since it is clear that the perception of interoceptive signals is depending on one's specific physiology . (4) Last but not least, there seems to be a tendency to poorer performance on the longer trials of the HPT. This statement is rejected by Ainley, Tsakiris, Pollatos, Schulz and Herbert  arguing that mean recorded heart rates significantly differed between the three lengths of the trials in the data of Zamariola, Maurage, Luminet and Corneille , which is in contrast to their assumption that the heart rate is constant across intervals and the poorer performance for longer trials is traced to participants' undercounting. In conclusion, the HPT is significantly connected to the activity of interoceptive neural networks, which has been shown in multiple studies , the HPT has been shown to provide information about the associations between an individual's interoceptive accuracy and psychological distress such as depression , anxiety  and even suicidality  and most of its critical points have been disproved. Thus, we feel secure about the use of this measure for assessing interoceptive accuracy. Third, participants had to complete the post assessment to the latest 14 days after the EMA phase. This was a wide time frame and should be kept shorter in future studies. It could be possible that practice effects already vanish within short periods of time. Fourth, the results could also be influences by the high percentage (88.5%) of female participants, since men seem to be better in perceiving interoceptive processes . However, Pennebaker and Roberts  suggest that those sex differences vanish in a nonlaboratory setting. For future studies, it would be interesting to examine sex differences in interoception as well as hormonal changes and their influence on interoception during EMA, which is not a typical laboratory setting. Conclusions The present study is the first to assess interoceptive accuracy, awareness and sensibility repeatedly across time by means of ecological momentary assessments. Results support the general validity of such a measurement approach and revealed considerable withinperson variability for all three facets. Practice effects were not found for interoceptive accuracy and awareness, but should be considered for interoceptive sensibility. The results call for replication in clinical samples. Increasing general scientific interest in research in interoception and a growing body of evidence suggesting its potential link to mental illnesses  call for further investigations. Recent research suggests that symptoms of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation show substantial within-person variance and fluctuate across time . Thus, future EMA-studies should consider investigating the prospective relations between interoception and symptoms of mental disorders to shed further light on its complex relations and potential interactions.

19,19,"Mental Health and Behavior of College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Mobile Smartphone and Ecological Momentary Assessment Study, Part II","Background: Since late 2019, the lives of people across the globe have been disrupted by COVID-19. Millions of people have become infected with the disease, while billions of people have been continually asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that it is associated with large-scale behavioral and mental health changes; however, few studies have been able to track these changes with frequent, near real-time sampling or compare these changes to previous years of data for the same individuals.Objective: By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data in a cohort of college-aged students enrolled in a longitudinal study, we seek to understand the behavioral and mental health impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, measured by interest across the United States in the search terms coronavirus and COVID fatigue.Methods: Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone use, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife mobile smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Spring 2020 term, as compared to previous terms in the same cohort, were modeled using mixed linear models.Results: Linear mixed models demonstrated differences in phone use, sleep, sedentary time and number of locations visited associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In further models, these behaviors were strongly associated with increased interest in COVID fatigue. When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, phone use, sedentary time), both anxiety and depression (P<.001) were significantly associated with interest in COVID fatigue. Notably, these behavioral and mental health changes are consistent with those observed around the initial implementation of COVID-19 lockdowns in the spring of 2020. Conclusions: In the initial lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, people spent more time on their phones, were moresedentary, visited fewer locations, and exhibited increased symptoms of anxiety and depression. As the pandemic persisted throughthe spring, people continued to exhibit very similar changes in both mental health and behaviors. Although these large-scale shiftsin mental health and behaviors are unsurprising, understanding them is critical in disrupting the negative consequences to mentalhealth during the ongoing pandemic.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 . In this work, we extend our previous research beyond the initial phases of the pandemic to June 25, 2020. By this time, the world had seen over 2,000,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 100,000 deaths , and the severe long-term political, economic, educational, and social ramifications of COVID-19 had grown increasingly acute. Understanding the behavioral and mental health implications for individuals during the spring of 2020, an unprecedented period of high stress, is critical for the upkeep of mental health during the pandemic. College students seem to be vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19 on mental health . In the spring of 2020, global health measures forced many colleges to shut down in an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus. On March 12, 2020, Dartmouth College requested that students leave the campus, with hope that the campus could resume normal operations in 5 weeks. At that time, it was believed that the COVID-19 situation would end rather quickly; however, by March 17, the severity of the virus became more apparent, and Dartmouth College announced that all classes and office hours would be held remotely during the Spring 2020 academic term. Students were asked to leave campus and not return until further notice. Following changes in school, local, and federal policies, drastic alterations in students' behavior were observed. Prior research found that during the initial stages of the pandemic, this cohort of students visited fewer locations, spent more time sedentary, and increased its phone use . All these behavioral changes were linked with increased levels of anxiety and depression , a trend observed by other researchers among various groups of college students . Despite the negative impact on their mental health, many students continued to practice physical distancing with the hope of a swift return to normalcy. Unfortunately, improved knowledge about the ways in which COVID-19 spreads made it increasingly clear that physical distancing and other measures needed to continue for the sake of public health. Although some localities began to ease their restrictions and reopen in April 2020, it was still widely suggested that people avoid public gatherings and maintain physical distance from others. COVID-19 Restrictions Over the Long Term Towns and cities across the United States were forced to sustain COVID-19 ""Stay Home, Stay Safe"" restrictions in an effort to stem the spread of COVID-19. The effort of adhering to these restrictions seems to have bred fatigue among people nationwide. Although there is evidence that these stay-at-home-orders resulted in an immediate suppression of negative changes in mental health brought on during this time , people grew weary of the effort required to maintain constant vigilance. For many, staying at home began to feel like a monotonous rut-many referred to this feeling as ""COVID fatigue."" Search term interest in COVID fatigue is seen alongside interest in coronavirus and the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases  (Figure ). Interest in COVID fatigue began to grow about a month into the pandemic (spiking in April) and continued to grow throughout the spring, while interest in coronavirus peaked around the time when policy changes were implemented in March before sharply and steadily declining. Therefore, COVID fatigue became an appropriate metric for measuring pandemic intensity at a given moment in time, while interest in the search term coronavirus seemed to capture the initial pandemic-related changes, reaching peak interest levels in late March. because many students continued to live under ""Stay Home, Stay Safe"" restrictions throughout the spring, it is necessary to understand how the sustenance of these behaviors is related to mental health. Over the last year, the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted multiple lockdowns, which have brought about increased interest in the search term COVID fatigue, a term that has quickly become the subject of much discussion in public health research . Cross-sectional research in Istanbul, Turkey, suggests that those with higher education levels experience more COVID-19-based fatigue , which may be attributable to a greater likelihood of this population to adhere to virus protocols and practice physical distancing . Recent work proposes that college students may experience increases in depression due to COVID fatigue . Most work measuring COVID fatigue has been limited to the use of web-based surveys. Using smartphone mobile sensing for digital phenotyping enables increased sampling frequency  and an ecologically valid approach , particularly when paired with ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). How behavioral and mental health changes related to COVID fatigue among populations at high risk for mental health issues (eg, college students) remains an unresolved question that we investigate in this work.  Modeling Stages of the Pandemic With Changes in Behavior and Mental Health Using previously successful methods, this work seeks to infer the behavioral and mental health impacts of the initial onset and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic among a cohort of Dartmouth College undergraduate students. Search query-related data are a promising metric in gathering population-based interest, which can be used to successfully identify changes in mental health . Prior work has shown EMAs to be an excellent tool for gathering real-time assessments of mental health . Notably, researchers have also used EMAs to assess mental health changes during the COVID-19 pandemic . Interest in the search terms coronavirus and COVID fatigue was gathered from Google Trends to quantify the initial and ongoing phases of the pandemic (Figure ). Interest levels were linearly inferred based on smartphone behavioral sensing data (gathered via passive sensing) and reported levels of anxiety and depression. Linear models are a useful tool in understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily behaviors and mental health in previous work, as a nearly identical method using COVID-19 media presence was previously successful . Previously, we observed that the early media presence of COVID-19 was associated with increased levels of anxiety and depression as well as increased sedentary time and phone use . This work seeks to build on prior work conducted by this and other groups to gain further insight into the ways in which COVID-19 has impacted daily life and mental health. We hypothesized that over nearly 3 months, students would continue to exhibit changes in depression, anxiety, and daily behaviors similar to those seen in the initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective In this work, we seek to understand the behaviors and mental health changes associated with the continuing phases of the pandemic, as inferred by interest in the search terms COVID fatigue and coronavirus. Methods Study Design All data from this study were obtained from the StudentLife study , which is a longitudinal multimodal study designed to follow the experiences of undergraduate students throughout their academic tenure with a focus on mental health. Study components include smartphone mobile sensing through the StudentLife app , EMAs, and surveys focusing on a variety of college experience components and functional neuroimaging . Participants Data were collected from 219 participants who agreed to provide mobile sensing data via the StudentLife app . One participant was removed from the study for having a phone incompatible with the app, and one participant withdrew within a week of starting the study. Data for both participants were excluded from further analyses. Of the remaining 217 participants, 67.8% (147) were female, with an age range of 18-22 years at the time of enrollment. Recruitment for this study began in August 2017 and concluded in November 2018. This study was reviewed and approved by Dartmouth College's Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects. All data analyzed were collected from September 9, 2017, through June 25, 2020. Academic Terms At Dartmouth College, the academic schedule consists of a flexible, year-round calendar that is roughly divided into 4 10-week academic terms (quarters), typically followed by 2 or more weeks of break. COVID-19 was first discovered in the United States during Dartmouth College's Winter 2020 term, which began on January 6, 2020. The Spring 2020 academic term (March 30 start date) was the first complete academic term that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. To graphically show differences in anxiety and depression related to COVID-19, academic terms, including the subsequent 2 weeks of break prior to the Winter 2020 term, were included as control terms. Mobile Sensing and Ecological Momentary Assessments Smartphone sensing data and EMA surveys were administered using the StudentLife application (iOS and Android) . The StudentLife app collects data from several of the phone's sensors, including but not limited to GPS, accelerometer, and lock/unlock status. Anonymized data from the StudentLife app are uploaded to a secure server whenever a participant is both connected to a Wi-Fi network and charging their phone. Data from these sensors are used to assess items such as the day-to-day and week-by-week impact of workload on stress, sleep, activity, mood, sociability, mental well-being, and academic performance . Students are prompted weekly by the StudentLife application to complete a few short surveys, administered as EMAs . These EMAs include the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), which combines a brief measure of depressive and anxious symptoms  that assesses how often individuals were bothered by specific symptoms over the last 2 weeks with values ranging from 0 to 6 for each subscale. The PHQ-4 combines the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2) tool. Sedentary Time Sedentary time, or stationary duration, is computed with algorithms that detect a lack of movement based on accelerometer data from a phone's sensors. This enables us to measure students' activity or, more precisely, their lack of activity level. The StudentLife app continuously infers physical activities using the Android activity recognition application programming interface  or iOS Core Motion . Sleep Sleep was inferred through a combination of passive sensing features (ambient light, movement activity, screen on/off). In this way, three features were computed: sleep onset, wake time, and sleep duration. These measures of sleep have been shown to be accurate within ±30 minutes of total sleep duration . Location Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)  was used to cluster GPS coordinates to determine the number of locations visited and distance traveled during a given time period. Locations were detected when 3 GPS samples (sampled every 10 minutes) were within a radius of 30 meters. Distance was calculated in meters traveled between all locations throughout the day. Phone Use Unlock duration is a measurement of time during which a user's phone is unlocked and the screen is on, calculated as the time between the user unlocking the phone and the user either manually relocking the phone or autolocking due to disuse (the iOS default is 30 seconds, Android defaults vary by manufacturer, and users can alter this time through their phone settings). Notification and system services do not influence the measurement of unlock duration. For the iOS app (189 users), from the start of the study in September 2017 until September 2018, unlock duration was measured by remotely triggering phones every 10 minutes, sampling 1 minute every 10 minute period (minimum 10% temporal coverage). After September 2018, phones were remotely triggered every 3 minutes, with subsequent sampling for 1 minute. Lock/unlock behaviors within that minute are recorded in real time, while locks/unlocks for the remaining 2 minutes are logged during the next remote trigger. The Android phone app natively supports phone use tracking and does not need to be triggered (28 users). Google Trends Google is the world's leading search engine, and Google Trends is an excellent tool to quantify topic interest. In turn, interest data from Google Trends have been successfully used to quantify changes in mental health . Google data are posted publicly, and data can be downloaded directly through Google's web portals or through freely available software. Google normalizes search data by region (in this case, the United States). To normalize the data, each data point is divided by the total searches of the geographic and time range it represents to compare relative popularity; the results are then scaled from a range of 0 to 100 based on a topic's proportion to all searches on all topics . Search terms with low interest appear as ""0,"" while ""100"" reflects peak interest during a given period. To obtain an unbiased measurement of interest in coronavirus and COVID fatigue, interest in both search terms was pulled for the duration of the entire study (September 7, 2017, to June 25, 2020). Data received from Google Trends were reported on a weekly scale; interest was reported for each Sunday. To gather a more finely grained real-time view of interest, the data was linearly interpolated using the ""approxm"" function from the Freqprof package in RStudio. Data Processing, Modeling, and Visualization in RStudio Modeling was implemented in lme4  and lmerTest . All plots were generated using ggplot2 . Result tables were produced using stargazer . On average, 164/217 participants (75.6%) reported mobile sensing data each day. For all participants with data, for the following behaviors, inferred through mobile sensing, daily group-level averages were calculated, standardized, and plotted over the time course of January to July 2020: locations visited, phone use, sleep, and time still (Figure ). The objective of the analyses was to determine how the shock and sustained nature of the pandemic impacted the participants' behaviors and mental health. The term week was modeled as linear and quadratic factors. To obtain a variable mirroring interest in coronavirus and COVID fatigue, topic interest in both coronavirus and COVID fatigue was gathered from Google Trends. Interest levels were modeled with fixed effects of reported depression and anxiety levels, unlock duration, unlock number, sedentary time, sleep duration, number of locations visited, and term week (linear and quadratic) variables, as well as random intercepts for each participant. For each variable, any days with missing data (14.47%) were excluded from the analysis. Each variable except participant was scaled to aid model convergence. P values were calculated using the Satterthwaite method as implemented in lmerModLmerTest as part of lmerTest.  Results Behavioral and Mental Health Changes Associated With the COVID-19 Pandemic To visually observe shifts in behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, standardized scores were produced for each behavior plotted with a vertical line marking the date on which the WHO named COVID-19 a pandemic (Figure ). Students visited fewer locations, used their phones more, spent more time sedentary, and initially exhibited increases in sleep before a sustained decrease in sleep. Notably, the graph shows less extreme peaks and valleys, suggesting that differences in behavior between weekdays and weekends were less pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mean values of depression and anxiety were plotted by week of the term; data were combined from all study participants from all terms prior to the Winter 2020 term, which was plotted as a separate line along with the Spring 2020 term. Standard error was plotted as a shaded ribbon surrounding the mean. Sustained increased levels of depression and anxiety throughout the Spring 2020 academic term compared to Winter 2020 and control terms were plotted (Figure ). Peak self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms were observed during the ninth week of the Spring term, corresponding to the time before final examinations, increases in COVID-19 cases, and the murder of George Floyd. Linear models were produced to better assess these differences in a more quantitative manner. Multiple models for sedentary time, phone use, sleep, locations visited, depression, and anxiety were tested (see the Methods section for specific details). For all mobile sensing variables except phone use, superior fit was observed with the most complex model that included the COVID-19 academic term, linear and quadratic term week trends, the interaction of the COVID-19 academic term with each of the term week trends, and allowance for random intercepts for each participant's data (random effects). For phone use, superior fit (measured by lowest deviance) was observed with the model including the COVID-19 academic term, linear and quadratic term week trends, and the interaction between the linear term week variable and the COVID-19 academic term. Modeling of the COVID-19 academic term compared with non-COVID-19 academic terms identified significantly increased sedentary time, phone use, sleep, depression, and anxiety, along with a decrease in locations visited (P<.001; Table ). Significant interactions of the COVID-19 term and quadratic term week regressor for sedentary time, locations visited, and anxiety (P<.001), as well as sleep and depression (P=.05), were observed. Significant interactions between the COVID-19 term and the linear term week regressor for locations visited, phone use, and anxiety (P<.001) as well as sedentary time (P=.01) and depression (P=.05) were also observed.  COVID-19 Interest, Mental Health, and Mobile Sensing After observing broad differences in sleep, phone use, locations visited, sedentary time, depression, and anxiety between the Winter 2020 term and previous terms, the next goal was to see if these behaviors changed on a daily scale, particularly mirroring the relative interests in coronavirus and COVID fatigue over the duration of the study. Interest in both variables was at zero until March 2020 (Figure ). To gather what behaviors changed with coronavirus interest and how they changed, we included fixed effects for phone use (unlock duration and unlock number), sedentary time, sleep duration, number of locations visited, and linear and quadratic academic term week regressors. Random intercepts per participant were included in the model. Each variable was scaled to help with convergence of the restricted maximum likelihood model and to obtain regression coefficients that can be compared for relative importance. Models inferring interest in COVID fatigue had a better fit (lower deviance) than models of coronavirus interest. All variables were significantly associated with interest in the search term coronavirus, and all variables except distance traveled were significantly associated with interest in COVID fatigue. In both models, phone use (unlock duration) had the largest positive standardized coefficient, followed by sedentary time. The number of locations visited had the largest magnitude of negative standardized coefficient, followed by the number of phone unlocks and sleep duration (P<.001). In the second set of models of interest data, we again made inferences with mobile sensing features, this time with the addition of self-reported anxiety and depression scores. Again, all variables seemed to produce a better fit when inferring interest in COVID fatigue. When anxiety and depression were added to the previously used sensing model, our model demonstrated that increased anxiety and depression were significantly associated with rising interest in coronavirus and COVID fatigue (P<.001). Again, we observed increased phone use (unlock duration), increased sedentary time, and decreased number of locations visited, with standardized beta weights stable across both models. Sleep was negatively associated with interest in COVID fatigue (P=.05) but no longer had a significant association with coronavirus interest, perhaps due to the weekly measured mental health metrics accounting for variance. Notably, both the linear and quadratic term week variables were positively associated with COVID fatigue interest, though only the quadratic term week variables were positively associated with coronavirus interest. A coefficient plot depicting the relative impacts on behaviors and mental health is shown in Figure .  Discussion Principal Findings As in our previous work, we found increased interest in COVID-19 to be associated with increased depression and anxiety alongside stark behavioral changes. Further linear models showed that as initial interest in the search term coronavirus increased, a cohort of 217 Dartmouth College undergraduate students became more sedentary, visited fewer locations, slept less, used their phones more, and showed increases in anxiety and depression. Although initial models suggested an increase in sleep during academic terms affected by COVID-19, controlling for other sensing variables revealed that students exhibited decreases in sleep as the pandemic endured. Although we observed an increase in distance traveled as coronavirus interest rose, we attribute this finding to students returning home, as it coincides with Dartmouth College closing its campus. We found that the search term coronavirus had a stronger relationship with changes in behaviors and mental health, with the exception of levels of depression. With sustained adherence to ""Stay Home and Stay Safe"" guidelines implemented by many national and international governments, we found that as the pandemic endured, students were more sedentary, visited fewer locations (as inferred from GPS tracking), slept less, used their phones more, and exhibited increases in anxiety and depression. Notably, over the entire course of the study, self-reported anxiety and depression levels were highest in the week after George Floyd was murdered. Future digital phenotyping work should investigate the impact of current events on mental health and behavior. Our models revealed that behaviors and mental health changed in response to the pandemic over a sustained period of time. Although this work is descriptive by nature, behavioral changes sometimes drive changes in mental health in a lagged manner. Notably, a comparison of contemporaneous correlations of data collected prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed a decrease in the strength of the correlations between sedentary time and mental health (anxiety and depression). Notably, the correlation between locations visited and anxiety also became weaker. Future COVID-19-related work investigating causal relationships between general daily travel, particular sedentary behaviors, and changes in mental health would be of high interest. Unfortunately, we remain engaged in a battle against the continued spread of COVID-19, necessitating long-term adherence to physical distancing and other mitigation protocols. Although the initial impact of these unprecedented shifts in behavior has been documented, the effects of the longevity of the pandemic are less known. This work uses longitudinal data from a cohort of 217 college students to observe what behavioral and mental health changes are associated with the enduring pandemic. As in previous work, we found increased interest in COVID-19 to be associated with increased depression and behavioral changes. Further linear models showed that as initial interest in coronavirus increased, participants became more sedentary, visited fewer locations, slept less, used their phones more, and showed increases in anxiety and depression. Although initial models suggested an increase in sleep during academic terms affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, controlling for other sensing variables revealed that students exhibited decreases in sleep as the pandemic endured. As in previous work , we again observed that COVID-19 is associated with decreased sleep, increased sedentary time, and negative mental health outcomes. Recent work, collected prepandemic, suggests that sleep may mediate a relationship between physical activity and stress . An overwhelming body of research supports the claim that increased physical activity is associated with longer, better quality sleep . On the other hand, physical inactivity tends to be associated with increased stress , and recent work suggests that exercising during the pandemic may help reduce levels of stress . Stress has been implicated in changes in mental health  and poor sleep . Importantly, other work identifies disturbances in sleep and physical activity that coincide with COVID-19 fatigue . Although the observed prolonged decreases in sleep may potentially mediate a relationship between sustained decreased physical activity and mental well-being during the pandemic, mental health research currently remains uncertain. Our finding of sustained increased phone use during the COVID-19 pandemic presents a quandary. Work prior to the pandemic suggests that smartphone overuse is associated with negative changes in mental health . However, at a time of widespread social distancing, it seems that smartphones may have a more complex relationship with mental health. Recent research has shown that using smartphones to connect with friends and colleagues may be associated with increased well-being during the pandemic . Moreover, social connection may provide resilience in battling COVID-19 fatigue . Simultaneously, increased phone use during the pandemic may reflect increased social media use and negative changes in mental health . Given the observance of increased phone use among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, future work may seek to uncover the various impacts of phone use during the pandemic. Primary takeaways from the models are that individuals are maintaining previously seen changes in behavior and mental health. This finding suggests the importance of prioritizing communication with loved ones, and it emphasizes the benefit of maintaining a regular sleep schedule and physical activity to help improve mental health. Study Limitations and Future Directions One possible limitation of this study is the search terms used. Although other literature reports use the term ""COVID fatigue"" to refer to behavioral exhaustion, it is worth noting that similar search terms listed on Google Trends are related to the symptomatology of COVID-19 (ie, fatigue related to virus contraction) rather than to behavioral fatigue. Our graphs show that interest in COVID fatigue begins to increase well into the pandemic, but after interest in coronavirus increases; however, it is possible that we are partially capturing interest in symptoms. Still, we observed that behaviors and mental health model interest in covid fatigue with a better fit than with interest in the term coronavirus; this finding suggests that the gradually building interest in COVID-19 fatigue accurately reflects the continuing phases, while interest in the disease itself reflects the initial phase. Future work may consider identifying trending search terms such as covid mutation or covid vaccine to help quantify the interest in the continuation of the pandemic and how that interest may be impacting mental health. Similarly, as vaccines are more widely distributed, using the terms covid vaccine and herd immunity along with the terms used in this work could be an effective way to model the impacts of later and (hopefully) final stages of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. Although the mobile smartphone sensing data gathered by the StudentLife app are quite robust, they too have potential limitations. When mobility is decreased, such as during a stay-at-home order, people may not always have their phones with them, which could lead to an overestimation of sedentary time and sleep. Our moderate sample size of 217 total participants across all terms and 212 participants during the COVID-19 pandemic (97.6%) limits the generalizability of the findings. Further, participants may be preferentially accessing larger screens (eg, tablets, laptops, or televisions). Because the app was only installed on the students' mobile phones, our metric of phone use (as measured by screen unlock duration or number of unlocks) may underestimate the total amount of screen time. However, we did observe increased phone use, suggesting that the effect sizes we observe are underestimated. Future digital phenotyping work capable of distinguishing different types of screen time during the pandemic would be of high interest, as would work that distinguishes the purposes (ie, working, watching Netflix, reading) and proportions of screen use. Further work could also use smartwatches to improve the measurement of behaviors such as sedentary time and allow for more frequent sampling of phone use, location and other measures. Additionally, the use of smartwatches could facilitate highly accurate inferences of time spent exercising, sleep and sedentary time, as these watches typically track heart rate. Despite the moderate sample size and potential data inaccuracies, strong significant effects on mental health and behaviors were observed, suggesting robust effects. Although finding ways to combat COVID-19 fatigue is beyond the scope of this work, we encourage more research on the subject. In our work, we were unable to infer daily changes in mental health, as to maximize long-term retention, the StudentLife app prompted participants to respond to weekly, not daily, EMAs. Although we presume that college students are likely to be more susceptible to experiencing pandemic fatigue, we do not directly gather fatigue-related feedback. Future studies may consider addressing fatigue more directly, although one should be cautious when choosing metrics of fatigue, as they may also be symptoms of depression (eg, physical exhaustion, anhedonia, trouble sleeping). Administering EMAs on a daily, rather than weekly, basis could help parse day-to-day changes in mental health related to fatigue. In light of the drastic changes in sedentary time, it is critical to find day-to-day activities or routines that may help prevent or reduce fatigue levels. There may be differences in the degree of reported mental health changes between those who spend more time watching television compared to those using social media. Although gathering enough participants may be challenging, using questionnaires to investigate specific behaviors that drive or reduce fatigue levels is critical. Comparison With Prior Work In the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the media presence of COVID-19 increased, individuals exhibited increased levels of depression and anxiety alongside increased sedentary time, phone use, and a decrease in the number of locations visited. This work examined if the same cohort of individuals exhibited the same changes in behaviors and mental health over the course of a 12-week academic term. Rather than using media presence, this work uses search term interest gathered from Google Trends, a tactic that has recently proved fruitful during the pandemic . In this work, we chose the search term COVID fatigue to measure the intensity of the pandemic at a given moment to add to the prior knowledge gained during the initial phases of the pandemic. This tactic enabled us to observe what behavioral and mental health changes were associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as opposed to focusing on the initial phase, as in prior work. In addition to previously observed shifts in mental health and behaviors, we observed significant decreases in sleep as the COVID-19 pandemic endured. Conclusions While the long fight against COVID-19 continues, we must further our understanding of its impacts on mental health. This study provides additional insight into mental health and related behaviors during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Using mixed linear models of smartphone mobile sensing and self-reported mental health questions, we were able to infer the initial and ongoing phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, as measured by search term interest in coronavirus and COVID fatigue; moreover, we were able to validate that the participants' mental health and related behaviors changed contemporaneously with relative interest levels in these terms. Increases in depression, anxiety, sedentary time, and phone use, alongside decreases in sleep and the number of locations visited, are significantly associated with the ongoing pandemic. All of these changes seem very similar to those seen during the initial phases of the pandemic. As the virus continues to mutate, in future work, we may attempt to identify behaviors as resilience factors for changes in mental health. Similarly, work tracking the distribution of vaccines may elucidate a return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels of behavior and mental health.

20,20,mHealth-Assisted Detection of Precursors to Relapse in Schizophrenia,"Theoretical views and a growing body of empirical evidence suggest that psychiatric relapses in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSDs) have measurable warning signs. However, because they are time-and resource-intensive, existing assessment approaches are not well-suited to detect these warning signs in a timely, scalable fashion. Mobile technologies deploying frequent measurements-i.e., ecological momentary assessment-could be leveraged to detect increases in symptoms that may precede relapses. The present study examined EMA measurements with growth curve models in the 100 days preceding and following 27 relapses (among n = 20 individuals with SSDs) to identify (1) what symptoms changed in the periods gradually preceding, following, and right as relapses occur, (2) how large were these changes, and (3) on what time scale did they occur. Results demonstrated that, on average, participants reported elevations in negative mood (d = 0.34), anxiety (d =0.49), persecutory ideation (d =0.35), and hallucinations (d =0.34) on relapse days relative to their average during the study. These increases emerged gradually on average from significant and steady increases (d = 0.05 per week) in persecutory ideation and hallucinations over the 100-day period preceding relapse. This suggests that brief (i.e., 1-2 item) assessments of psychotic symptoms may detect meaningful signals that precede psychiatric relapses long before they occur. These assessments could increase opportunities for relapse prevention as remote measurement-based care management platforms develop.","[""technology"", ""mobile health"", ""schizophrenia"", ""relapse"", ""ecological momentary assessment""]",10.3389/fpsyt.2021.642200,"INTRODUCTION Relapses in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSDs) are devastating. In addition to disrupting the lives of individuals experiencing them, each relapse event cumulatively increases the likelihood of subsequent relapses , dysfunction (2), poor treatment response , and suicide . Relapses in SSDs often culminate in psychiatric hospitalizations, which are among the costliest elements in healthcare . This is a key reason why SSDs are a leading cause of global disability and healthcare costs , costing more than $102 billion worldwide . Relapses are typically preceded by smaller elevations in symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, suspiciousness, anxiety) that are potentially detectable before full-blown relapse . Intervening to address these symptoms rapidly has the potential to help mitigate the likelihood of relapse and associated sequelae. Existing approaches used to detect relapse risk are limited by problems with feasibility. Symptoms are typically evaluated through clinical impressions, in-person interviews, or clinicianadministered rating scales, which require direct contact with a trained provider. Depending on in-person interactions limits potential reach and scalability, as structured symptom assessments are time and resource intensive, and because the majority of individuals with serious mental illnesses are not regularly engaged in care . Further, rater-administered scales require respondents to summarize their experiences over long periods of time. This approach is susceptible to inaccuracies related to memory errors/recall bias , interpretive errors , or assessment demand characteristics . Mobile devices can be used to deploy a series of brief, selfreport measures administered during patients' day-to-day lives [i.e., ecological momentary assessment or EMA; ] using mobile technologies that many people with SSDs already have . These approaches not only have the potential to improve detection of relapse risk but also to characterize changes that occur in the post-relapse period as well, and to establish trajectory models. Assessment systems using EMA [(19) for a review] are feasible and acceptable to patients with chronic SSDs  as well as early psychosis . The information provided by EMA could be useful in clinical settings aiming to detect symptom increases that signal impending relapse or to track recovery during high-risk periods (i.e., after hospitalizations). New approaches using weekly assessments of aggregate warning signs collected via mobile SMS  have demonstrated that rather than occurring in a 2-4 week period as has been previously hypothesized, patients report gradual increases that begin 2 months before a relapse . Few studies have assessed changes in individual symptoms that precede and follow relapses with mobile devices. A more granular understanding of the symptom increases that precede relapses could help identify which individual symptoms change prior to relapse, what degree of increases might indicate impending relapse, and on what time scale these changes might be detected. This information could inform the further development of assessments aiming to better detect and prevent the onset of relapse and to inform attempts to understand relevant underlying biological/pharmacological processes. Ben-Zeev and colleagues deployed a multi-modal mobile assessment system-CrossCheck-in a sample of individuals with schizophrenia for 12 months . This system administered EMA scales up to three times per week over this period. The present study aims to determine whether a brief report of individual symptoms assessed via EMA detects changes occurring before, during, and after psychiatric relapses. We operationalize this approach by examining (1) whether and to what degree EMA responses assessing symptoms change before relapse, (2) whether mean values predicted by those models on the day of relapse differ from participant averages throughout the study period, and (3) whether and to what degree responses change following relapse. MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants Participants were recruited from a large psychiatric hospital in New York via on-site flyers as well as study staff review of hospital electronic medical records. The clinicians of potentially eligible individuals were contacted by a member of the research team and were asked to provide these individuals with a study description. A member of the study team reached out to participants who gave their clinician authorization to pass along their names and contact information. Prospective participants received a detailed description of the study before being evaluated for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were (1) being 18 years or older; (2) having a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychosis not otherwise specified; and (3) the occurrence of an inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, daytime psychiatric hospitalization, outpatient crisis management visit, or shortterm psychiatric hospital emergency room visit within the last 12 months. Individuals were excluded if they (1) had hearing, vision, or motor impairments that would interfere with the use of a smartphone (determined using a demonstration smartphone during screening); (2) had a reading level below 6th grade [determined using the reading section of the Wide Range Achievement Test; ]; or (3) a lack of competency to consent. Procedure Participants were randomized to one of two conditions: (1) the intervention condition (i.e., access to the CrossCheck system and as needed follow-up for 12 months), or (2) treatment as usual (i.e., no change to participants usual care over the same period). Participants in both conditions were asked to attend in-person data collection visits every 3 months. At these visits, participants were administered the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS; ], a 24-item interview-rated assessment of an array of symptoms of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Baseline characteristics of participants-including those who experienced a relapse and those who did not during the study period (33)-are reported elsewhere. Data for the present report are drawn from participants (n = 61) randomized to the CrossCheck condition. All participants in this condition were asked to carry a study device with them for 12 months. These devices were Samsung Galaxy S5 Android smartphones with unlimited data plans. Participants were instructed to charge the device each night while sleeping to reduce instances of missing data. This device had an integrated mobile monitoring assessment system called CrossCheck pre-installed. CrossCheck deployed EMA self-report scales and collected data from sensors that are embedded in most contemporary smartphones including accelerometers and Global Position System (GPS). A full description of the study software  as well as previous results involving passive sensing are reported elsewhere . Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) CrossCheck prompted participants to complete a 10-item EMA self-report survey three times per week (i.e., all Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays), with the prompt, ""Just checking in Prompt: Just checking in to see how you've been doing over the last few days. Negative affect Have you been DEPRESSED? Have you been HOPEFUL about the future? (R) Anxiety Have you been feeling STRESSED? Have you been feeling CALM? (R) Hallucinations Have you been bothered by VOICES? Have you been SEEING THINGS other people can't see? Persecutory ideation Have you been worried about people trying to HARM you? Sleep Have you been SLEEPING well? 0, Not at all; 1, A little; 2, Moderately; 3, Extremely. R, Reverse scored in the present analysis. to see how you've been doing over the last few days."" A full list of EMA items can be found in Table ; response options to each question ranged from 0 (not at all) to 3 (extremely). In addition to symptoms of psychosis, EMA items also assessed overall mental health (e.g., stress, depression, hopefulness, calmness, clarity of thought), and functioning (e.g., socialization, sleep). For the present study, we identified five variables based on research  suggesting that negative mood, anxiety, hallucinations, and delusions are elevated in assessments that precede relapses. Two of those items-persecutory ideation, and self-reported sleep quality-were assessed with a single item, while three-negative mood (average of the ""depression"" item and reverse-coded ""hopefulness"" item), anxiety (""stress"" item and reverse-coded ""calm"" item), and hallucinations (average of ""seeing things"" and ""voices"" items)-were assessed as composite scores. These items are listed in Table . Assessment of Relapse Hospital electronic health record data were made available to the research team for tracking psychiatric relapses during the study period. Trained study staff identified potential relapses from this record with final confirmation by the study PI (DBZ). The following events, reported during study assessments or recorded in the medical record, were designated as relapses: psychiatric hospitalization, significant increase in the level of psychiatric care (i.e., frequency and intensity of services, dosage increase or additional medicines prescribed) together with either an increase of 25% from baseline on BPRS total score, suicidal or homicidal ideation that was clinically significant in the investigators' judgment, deliberate self-injury, or violent behavior resulting in damage to another person or property . When documentation of the relapse date was unavailable (e.g., instances of self-reported suicidal ideation that did not lead to hospitalization or suicide attempt) assessors gathered data about the specific relapse event date directly from study participants. Data Analytic Plan We deployed latent growth curve analysis within a multilevel modeling framework to model gradual changes in symptoms over 100-day periods before and after relapse, as well as sudden changes in symptoms before vs. after relapse. Specifically, we modeled discontinuous growth curves to characterize separate trajectories of changes in symptoms over time before and after relapse and sudden changes in symptoms on the day of relapse. Similar analytic approaches have been used to model gradual and sudden changes in symptoms for other disorders (e.g., substance use disorders) with respect to other significant events [e.g., initiating abstinence from alcohol  or tobacco ]. Growth curve models included fixed effects for (a) linear change over time in the 100 days before relapses, (b) linear change for the 100 days following the relapse, and (c) sudden changes in expected values from the end of the pre-relapse period to the beginning of the post-relapse period. Random subject-level terms for all three of these effects were also entered into this model, as well as a random intercept, to account for between-subject heterogeneity in symptom trajectories. Growth curve models were analyzed within a multilevel modeling framework (repeated measures nested within persons) and a separate model was fit for each symptom measure. Models were fit using maximum likelihood estimation, which reduces bias and improves precision when data are missing at random or missing completely at random . Time variables for modeling gradual change were scaled such that a one-unit increase in time reflected a 1-week period for the pre or post relapse period, and the time variable reflecting sudden change was dummy coded as 0 during the pre-relapse period and 1 in the post-relapse period. Thus, model coefficients indicated the rate of change in symptoms per week during the pre or post relapse period, and the amount of sudden change in symptoms when transitioning from pre relapse to post relapse (beyond what was attributable to the gradual change over time trajectories). Because our analyses aimed to examine gradual changes over periods consistent with previous research , our models included EMA data within 100 days before or after relapse. For individuals with more than one psychiatric relapse (n = 4), each relapse was included in the analysis and time variables reflecting ""weeks to relapse"" and ""weeks from relapse"" were split at the halfway point between the two relapses. In a sensitivity analysis, we conducted analyses a second time with second relapses excluded for these four participants and an identical pattern of results were found. EMA variables were person-mean centered such that the zero point in all models represented the participant's average EMA response during the full study period. This allowed for interpretation of intercepts as the model-inferred difference between participants' expected symptom ratings on the day of relapse compared to their overall average response to that EMA item during the study period. RESULTS Relapses Twenty-seven relapse events occurred during the study period across 20 participants; models predicting relapse examine this subset of individuals. Of those events, they were characterized (non-mutually exclusively) as follows: psychiatric hospitalization (n = 22, 81.48%), increased frequency of services (n = 7, 25.93%), increased medication and BPRS increase (n = 6, 22.22%), suicidal ideation (n = 4, 14.81%) homicidal ideation (n = 1, 3.70%), self-injury (n = 2, 7.41%), violence (n = 1, 3.70%). At baseline, participants who went on to relapse did not significantly differ from those who did not relapse with regard to age, gender, race, ethnicity, diagnosis, or number of past psychiatric hospitalizations (past year or lifetime). All model estimates are provided in Tables . Parameter estimates in each model represent (1) the average participantcentered EMA value on the relapse day (""Intercept""), (2) immediate changes that occur from the end of the pre-relapse period to the beginning of the post-relapse period (""Immediate change""), (3) rates of change in the EMA values per week before relapse (""Gradual pre-relapse change""), and (4) rates of change in the EMA values after relapse (""Gradual post-relapse change""). All model-implied growth curves are displayed in Figures . Negative Mood Results from growth curve models examining change in EMA report of negative mood over time are reported in the first heading of Table . On the day of relapse, participants had significantly more negative mood compared to their average in the study (d = 0.34). Overall, this suggests a significantly elevated negative mood when relapse occurred (see Figure ). There were no other significant effects in the model; however, there was a non-significant (p = 0.054) gradual increase in negative mood (d = 0.04 per week) that over the 100-day pre-relapse period. Anxiety Results from growth curves examining anxiety are reported in the second heading of Table . On the day of relapse, participants had model-implied ratings that indicated a statistically significant elevation in anxiety (d = 0.49). There were no other significant terms in the model. Overall, this provides support for elevations when relapse occurred (see Figure ). There was a nominal gradual increase that occurred during the 100-day pre-relapse period (d = 0.04 per week, p = 0.075), as well as an immediate decrease when the relapse occurred (d = −0.45, p = 0.06), but both of these effects were non-significant. Sleep Parameter estimates from growth curves related to sleep are reported in the third heading of Table . There were no significant effects in the model. There were two non-significant effects of similar magnitude including a reduction in reported quality of sleep on the day of relapse relative to average in the study period (d = 0.41), as well as an immediate increase in sleep quality (d = 0.64) when the relapse period began. Persecutory Ideation Growth curve models examining persecutory ideation are reported in the first heading of Table . On the day of relapse, models inferred an elevated persecutory ideation score relative to participants' mean response (d = 0.35). This resulted from a significant linear increase during the 100-day pre-relapse period (d = 0.05 per week). Overall, this curve seems to suggest a steady but small increase in persecutory ideation over time before relapse and an elevation as the relapse occurred. There were no other significant effects in this model; however, there was a non-significant (p = 0.08) negative slope in the post-relapse period (d = 0.04). Hallucinations Parameter estimates from growth curves related to hallucinations are reported in the second heading of Table . On the day of relapse, models inferred an elevated rating of hallucinations relative to the participant mean (d = 0.34). This resulted from a significant positive slope in the 100-day pre-relapse period (d = 0.05 per week). No significant immediate change was found from the pre-relapse to post-relapse period or during the postrelapse period. Overall, this model suggests a steady increase in hallucinations in pre-relapse period, as well as an elevation relative to average when relapse occurs (see Figure ).  DISCUSSION Results demonstrated that a brief mobile EMA system detected changes in self-reported mood and psychotic symptoms that occurred in the period preceding relapse, both gradually over time before the relapse and immediately as psychiatric relapses occur. A series of growth curve models suggested that there were elevations in negative mood (d = 0.34), anxiety (d = 0.49), persecutory ideation (d = 0.35), and hallucinations (d = 0.34) on relapse days relative to average, and steady increases in persecutory ideation and hallucinations were evident in the 100-day period preceding relapse. These increases represented a small effect (d = 0.05 for both hallucinations and persecutory ideation) each week for the duration of the pre-relapse period. This suggests that brief assessments (i.e., 1-2 items) may register changes in each of these domains that occur in the 100 days that precede psychiatric relapses. Brief assessments of persecutory ideation and hallucinations, administered multiple times per week, appear to detect a signal that could indicate risk. In general, the present study provides preliminary support for the validity of EMA in providing information relevant to consequential clinical events. A brief EMA questionnaire appeared to detect changes in relation to meaningful and impactful clinical events. Because the financial and resource cost to administer EMA questionnaires is so low, the growing evidence supporting the utility of this information makes a compelling case for the use of remote monitoring in routine clinical care. The questionnaire deployed in the present study is brief (i.e., <2 min to complete), technologically simple, and does not require clinical staff to administer or calculate total scores. Indications of risk from EMA could trigger clinician outreach, indicate an increase in inperson sessions, or be used to encourage deployment of evidence-based mHealth self-management interventions directly to patients . Our results suggested that low-level symptoms appeared to build up in the period leading up to relapse. Such subtle changes that may not be noticeable to individuals could potentially be detected with routine monitoring systems. Clinical interventions aiming to prevent or reduce the impact of psychiatric relapses may benefit from targeting individuals who sustain increases in these domains over time. Interventions that provide support and self-management strategies, even in response to small symptom increases, could provide benefits that prevent a costly and debilitating full relapse. One limitation of the present study pertains to the size of the sample, as only 20 participants in the study relapsed during the study period, this limits statistical power to identify populationlevel trends in self-reported symptoms. While the lack of significance of these effects precludes further interpretation, there were several effects that fell just below (i.e., p < 0.10) the threshold for statistical significance: gradual increases in the pre-relapse period in negative mood and anxiety, reductions in reported quality of sleep at the time of relapse, immediate post-relapse reductions in anxiety and sleep problems, and gradual post-relapse reductions in persecutory ideation. The study's lack of power may have reduced likelihood of finding significance. Future studies with larger samples, longer EMA periods, and more frequent assessments have the potential to clarify these areas. Second, as our EMA was administered on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday each week for the study period, there are many days during which participants did not provide any data. It is possible periods of missing data are aligned with precisely the periods during which participants are at greatest risk for relapse, as it may be difficult to complete EMA questionnaires when experiencing severe symptoms. Future longitudinal studies would be strengthened with a greater frequency of assessments, which could be feasible in light of the fact that participants with SMI in EMA studies report that they do not find these assessments to be burdensome . While the questionnaire deployed assessed a range of symptoms, it was not designed for the purpose of assessment of early warning signs. Other systems examining EMAs have developed questionnaires expressly for this purpose . Importantly, during the CrossCheck study, members of the study team reached out to several participants who appeared at risk of relapse. Though clinically and ethically indicated in the study protocol, it is possible that taking these steps reduced the number of relapses during the study period and thus attenuated the strength of the relationships between EMA self-reported symptoms and relapse. Last, research examining emerging technologies using EMA along with passive sensors in this population has noted that the application of these data may be most useful ideographically and not only a population scale . While the present study took such a population-based approach, this does not rule out idiosyncratic patterns (i.e., ""relapse signatures"") (28) that characterize specific individualized risk. As clinical EMAs continue to expand into research and routine clinical care, future studies should continue to characterize trajectories of symptom change that precede and follow relapses in larger samples and with greater granularity. The present study characterizes in greater depth the temporal changes in symptoms that characterize schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. In addition to reporting elevations in anxiety, negative mood, hallucinations and persecutory ideation right as relapses occur, participants also reported significant gradual increases, week-by-week, in persecutory ideation and hallucination in the lead up to relapses. Though brief and easy to administer, self-reported symptoms could provide critical information for remote measurement-based care management potentially aiding in detecting elevated risk and monitoring response to interventions . Applying this approach in psychiatry would mirror preventive interventions for physical health, for example, the treatment of risk factors for cardiovascular disease to prevent heart attacks rather than initiating treatment after they occur. If deployed proactively, psychiatric interventions could similarly reduce the significant impact of SSDs on healthcare systems and the lives of those affected. "
21,21,Neurobiological and Psychological Maintenance Mechanisms Associated with Anticipatory Reward in Bulimia Nervosa,"The purpose of this investigation is to identify the anticipatory reward mechanisms that maintain binge eating and purging in bulimia nervosa. Emerging data indicate the importance of reward and anticipatory processes as maintenance mechanisms of bulimia nervosa that can be targeted in treatment. The proposed research will identify neurobiological and psychological anticipatory mechanisms of binge eating and purging using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in the natural environment. In this investigation, 60 adults (30 with bulimia nervosa and 30 matched comparison participants) will undergo negative and positive mood inductions followed by an fMRI food selection task (and a comparison shopping task) to examine neurobiological and affective responses to food and non-food reward anticipation. Participants with bulimia nervosa will complete two weeks of EMA examining realtime affect changes in relation to the anticipation of binge eating and purging. These methods will facilitate rigorous assessment of the links between neurobiological (fMRI) and naturalistic (EMA) data in anticipatory reward processes. Findings from this investigation will inform the conceptualization and treatment of bulimia nervosa by identifying the role of reward anticipation in symptom maintenance, providing a crucial framework for targeting these anticipatory processes in existing and novel interventions.","[""bulimia nervosa"", ""fMRI"", ""EMA""]",10.20900/jpbs.20210005,"INTRODUCTION Bulimia nervosa (BN) is an eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating and purging along with negative self-evaluation of shape and weight. With prevalence rates of 1-3% , BN is associated with significant medical and psychiatric comorbidity including mood, anxiety, and personality disorders . Although evidence-based interventions including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) have been developed, BN often persists in spite of treatment , indicating ineffectively targeted maintenance mechanisms. Treatment outcome data suggest that only 30-45% of adults who receive treatment for BN exhibit prolonged remission . Further, BN is often characterized by a worsening course in which symptom severity increases with duration of illness  Existing BN treatments, including CBT, typically focus on immediate antecedents and consequences of bulimic behavior. However, it is possible that the reward derived from these behaviors may occur earlier, during the anticipation of binge eating and purging. Determining the role of reward anticipation in BN will facilitate the application of novel interventions that more precisely target these maintenance mechanisms. Current research suggests that BN results from a complex combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental contributors including adverse life events and sociocultural influences, along with predisposing, precipitating, and maintaining factors . Longitudinal data indicate that weight and shape concerns, the internalization of the thin ideal, dieting, and body dissatisfaction among youth are predictive of BN behaviors , as well as relational and familial factors . Adverse life events including trauma are also associated with BN . Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the association between BN and phenotypic features including behavioral inhibition and disinhibition, personality traits (perfectionism, impulsivity, negative urgency), neurocognitive processes (attention biases), and neurobiological responses (e.g., activation in reward circuitry) . Empirical findings are consistent with the behavioral susceptibility theory, suggesting that genetic vulnerability influences the responsiveness to food cues, appetite dysregulation, and reward learning (which are associated with functional connectivity and brain circuits associated with reward, described below) . Research also supports the critical role of emotion as a longitudinal risk factor  and a precipitant of BN behaviors, as well as the likelihood that negative emotion enhances the reward value of food-related stimuli . Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) research, which measures symptoms under realtime and real-world conditions, has also supported an affect regulation model to explain the rewarding nature of bulimic symptoms . This research demonstrates that, at a group level, the occurrence of binge eating and purging is precipitated by decreasing positive affect and increasing negative affect, which, respectively, increase and decline after the occurrence of binge-eating and purging behaviors. As a result, binge eating and purging may be negatively reinforced by the reduction in the experience of negative affect and positively reinforced by increases in the experience of positive affect. Laboratory research has similarly established the temporal link between affect and bulimic behaviors as well as selfreported planning of binge-eating and purging episodes . Emerging neurobiological data parallel findings from EMA and laboratory studies to support the role of affective processing in binge eating and purging among individuals with BN, particularly in two neural circuits. The first is the striatal approach network, which involves dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmentum and the substantia nigra to striatal regions including nucleus accumbens, caudate, and putamen, which in turn receive regulatory input from frontal regions (e.g., orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex). Although multiple parallel loops within this overall system have been described , the ventral parts of the striatum (e.g., nucleus accumbens) are generally implicated in positive affect as well as immediate reward receipt and more dorsal portions of the striatum (e.g., caudate, putamen) are involved in cognition and motor control enacting responses informed by a history of reward learning . The second network, the limbic threat network, underlies the expression and regulation of negative affect  and includes structures such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and insula that underlie negative emotion, while associated frontal regions (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex) serve a regulatory function . Individuals with BN have demonstrated enhanced reactivity in brain regions associated with the striatal approach system (e.g., nucleus accumbens, caudate, orbitofrontal cortex) and decreased reactivity in regions associated with the limbic threat system (e.g., amygdala)  during exposure to food cues, further supporting the premise that aspects of binge eating (and, potentially, purging) are associated with the processing of desirable affective states. Because binge eating and purging as well as related cues have been shown to be associated with positive reinforcement by increases in positive affect (and activity in the approach network) and negative reinforcement through reduction of negative affect (and decreased activity in the threat network), evidence-based behavioral treatments of BN have generally focused on immediate precipitants and consequences of these behaviors . However, given that the majority of individuals with BN (~75%) plan some or most of their binge-eating and purging episodes , the rewarding effects of these behaviors may also occur long before the occurrence of the behavior during the distal anticipation stage, which is not emphasized in current models of BN. Although reward disturbances associated with psychopathology have often been understood in terms of generalized deficits and surfeits, more recent models recognize that the reward processes that promote symptom expression are not homogenous within psychiatric populations . Therefore, more comprehensive theories that parse different aspects of reward processing have been encouraged to develop more accurate models of psychiatric disorders . The distinction between the mechanisms of reward anticipation and reward consumption has emerged as especially important, with data indicating that disturbances in these different processes characterize different forms of psychopathology  and stages of illness . These anticipatory mechanisms are reflected in patterns of brain activity, with individuals with addictive disorders demonstrating greater striatal activity coupled with decreased striatal connectivity to prefrontal structures during reward anticipation . These data parallel animal models that indicate that dopamine release shifts temporally from reward receipt to anticipation over repeated negative or positive reinforcement trials . In this context, reward anticipation may be an important but neglected mechanism in the conceptualization of BN, which may be particularly relevant during more chronic, treatment resistant stages of the disorder. Although existing maintenance models of BN have begun to address the role of anticipatory reward, these models have not sufficiently examined the potential reward mechanisms associated with more distal anticipation and planning. Understanding anticipatory mechanisms in BN is critical for identifying treatment targets for those who do not respond to standard treatments like CBT, which typically focus on more immediate behavioral precipitants. Along these lines, novel treatments are emerging that target anticipatory reward separately from consummatory reward mechanisms associated with eating behavior . In sum, despite (a) the role of low positive affect and high negative affect as precipitants of binge eating and purging, (b) the role of post-behavioral increases in positive affect and decreases in negative affect (as well as parallel neurobiological processes) as reward processes promoting binge eating and purging, (c) robust clinical data supporting the frequency of planned binge-eating and purging episodes in BN, and (d) emerging data demonstrating the importance of reward anticipation in psychiatric disorders, the psychological and neurobiological impact of binge-eating and purging anticipation is unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the psychological and neurobiological aspects of reward anticipation in BN from the theoretical lens of behavioral susceptibility and reward learning. Identifying these reward processes will expand treatment targets to the anticipatory mechanisms of BN. This investigation will use fMRI and EMA to examine anticipatory reward among adults with BN (n = 30) and comparison participants (n = 30). Specifically, fMRI procedures will include two tasks: a food choice task and a comparison (non-food related) shopping task. Affective and neurobiological responses to both tasks following negative affect and positive affect induction will be compared within participant groups with duration of illness a moderator for the BN group. The BN group will also complete a two-week EMA protocol to investigate planning and anticipation of binge-eating/purging behavior as well as affect in the naturalistic environment (because the comparison participants will have no history of binge eating, they will not complete these EMA procedures). EMA and fMRI data will be examined to determine the relationship between self-reported anticipation of binge eating and purging in the natural environment and neurobiological responses on the fMRI food choice task. The specific aims and hypotheses of the investigation are described in the following section. GRANT AIMS Aim 1. Identity the Neural and Affective Reward Correlates of Anticipating Binge Eating and Purging in BN Hypothesis 1.1.-We hypothesize that following negative mood induction, participants with BN will show lower levels of self-reported negative affect, lower levels of activation in regions of the limbic threat network (e.g., amygdala, insula), and greater frontolimbic connectivity during an fMRI food choice task compared to the shopping task. We hypothesize that in contrast, healthy comparison participants will show no differentiation in these responses between tasks after a negative mood induction. Hypothesis 1.2.-We hypothesize that following positive mood induction, participants with BN will show higher levels of self-reported positive affect, higher levels of activation in regions of the striatal approach network (e.g., nucleus accumbens, caudate), and lower frontostriatal connectivity during an fMRI food choice task compared to the shopping task. We hypothesize that in contrast, healthy comparison participants will show no differentiation in these responses between tasks after positive mood induction. Hypothesis 1.3.-We hypothesize that for participants with BN, illness duration will moderate responses to an fMRI food choice task. Specifically, we predict that longer illness duration will be associated with: (a) less negative affect, less activation of the limbic threat network, and more frontolimbic connectivity following the negative mood induction; and (b) more positive affect, more activation of striatal approach regions, and less frontostriatal connectivity following the positive mood induction. Aim 2. Determine the Associations between Neurobiological, Behavioral, and Self-Reported Reward Indices Responses to Binge-Eating and Purging Behavior Anticipation in the Natural Environment Hypothesis 2.1.-We hypothesize that the magnitude of EMA negative affect reduction with binge-eating and purging behavior among individuals with BN will be associated with the magnitude of limbic threat network activity and frontolimbic connectivity observed during an fMRI food choice task in the negative mood induction condition. Hypothesis 2.2.-We hypothesize that the magnitude of EMA positive affect increase with binge-eating and purging behavior among individuals with BN will be associated with the magnitude of striatal approach network activity and frontostriatal connectivity during an fMRI food choice task in the positive mood induction condition. Hypothesis 2.3.-We hypothesize that greater EMA b inge-eating and purging frequency will correlate with greater magnitude of reductions in negative affect and increases in positive affect associated with binge-eating and purging anticipation as measured by EMA. We also hypothesize that greater EMA binge-eating and purging frequency will also correlate with fMRI measures of limbic threat and striatal approach network activity, as well as connectivity among individuals with BN. INNOVATION 1. (1) This study is the first to propose a novel approach to establish the role of anticipatory reward mechanisms in a maintenance model of BN and to examine reward anticipation independently from reward consumption, which holds promise for identifying important novel targets for the treatment of BN. 2. (2) This study administers an established food choice task during fMRI to identify the extent to which the anticipation of binge-eating and purging episodes impacts reactivity and connectivity of two key neural circuits (threat and approach networks). Because there is little research on circuit connectivity in response to disorder-relevant contexts in BN, this study contributes added complexity to neurobiological models of binge eating and purging. 3. (3) The combination of fMRI with EMA is an emerging novel approach in psychiatric research  to examine the relations between neuroimaging data and naturalistic behavior and affect in the ""real world"". Examining the link between self-reported affect and the neural processes associated with anticipating binge eating and purging in the scanner along with EMA is an innovative approach to establish the ecological validity of fMRI findings. This study is also the first to examine anticipation of binge eating and purging using EMA. 4. (4) This study provides a potential model for understanding the role of illness duration in BN by examining the extent to which reward anticipation strengthens over the course of the illness. PRELIMINARY WORK Neurobiological Changes in Reward and Emotion Regions Are Associated with Binge-Eating and Purging Anticipation in BN Our preliminary data suggest that the anticipation of binge eating directly impacts brain regions associated with emotion and reward in BN. This pilot study  included nine females (mean age = 20.22, SD = 2.39), six with BN and three with no eating disorder. In the scanner, following negative mood induction, participants were shown pictures of palatable food and were instructed to plan a binge-eating episode by selecting pictures of foods that they were told that they could eat in private following the scan. Participants completed a parallel ""neutral"" task in which they were shown pictures of furniture that they could select to furnish an apartment. Compared to the non-BN participants, the BN group showed lower activation across the bilateral amygdala and greater activation across the bilateral caudate during the binge-eating planning compared to the furniture selection task. These findings suggest that binge eating in BN may be rewarded through altered neurobiological responses during the anticipated occurrence of binge eating and purging. However, further data are needed to examine circuit-level alterations during binge-eating and purging episode anticipation. EMA-Measured Changes in Negative Affect and Positive Affect Contribute to Binge-Eating and Purging Maintenance in BN and Other Eating Disorders Using EMA, our collaborative research team has demonstrated that the trajectories of increases in negative affect and reductions in positive affect that occur prior to the onset of binge eating (and purging) are followed by negative affect reduction and positive affect enhancement after the occurrence of the behavior. These findings have been replicated across different types of eating disorders including BN, anorexia nervosa, and binge eating in obesity . These data support the premise that reward processes (i.e., negative and positive reinforcement through affect alteration) play a critical role in the maintenance of BN. However, previous EMA studies have not examined the impact of the anticipation of binge eating and purging on the trajectories of negative affect and positive affect in the natural environment. Frontostriatal Connectivity Patterns Are Related to Symptoms in Binge-Eating Samples We recently examined the resting state functional connectivity of reward circuitry in 27 adults with binge-eating disorder compared with 21 control participants . Compared to the control participants, the binge eating disorder group showed lower resting state functional connectivity in the striatal regions, with frontal regions (superior frontal gyrus) mediating executive processes and posterior, parietal, and temporal regions associated with emotional processing. Summary Our preliminary data indicate that abnormalities in affect-based reward processes, as well as underlying disturbances in associated neurobiology (e.g., approach and threat circuits), contribute to the perpetuation of binge-eating and purging behaviors in BN. Our data also underscore that anticipation, independent of the behavior itself, may be rewarding in BN. Taken together, these results suggest that the neurobiologically-driven processes related to reward anticipation in addition to reward receipt may be critical to BN maintenance. RESEARCH APPROACH Participants 60 participants (30 with BN, 30 sex-, age-, and ethnicity-matched individuals without BN) will be recruited through online and community and clinic advertising. Specifically, recruitment flyers will be placed in local eating disorder treatment program locations, on college campuses, and throughout the local community. In addition, advertisements will be placed in mainstream and on-line advertisements, including social media. Inclusion criteria: All participants: age 18-55; right-handed. BN group: DSM-5 diagnosis of BN , defined as at least one binge eating and one self-induced vomiting per week for the past three months; binge-eating episodes are always accompanied by self-induced vomiting episodes; stable dose (at least six weeks) of any medications impacting mood, appetite, or weight (for example, stimulants, birth control pills, antidepressant medications). Non-BN comparison group: no current or past history of an eating disorder; no current medication impacting mood, appetite, or weight. Exclusion criteria: history of gastric bypass surgery; medical condition acutely affecting eating behavior and/or weight including pregnancy, lactation, thyroid disease); current medical or psychiatric instability (e.g., hospitalization required in the past three months, acute suicidality); lifetime history of psychosis or bipolar disorder; lifetime history of neurological disorder or head injury with greater than 10 minutes loss of consciousness; inability to read English; current substance use disorder; body mass index less than 19 kg/m 2 ; MRI incompatibility (e.g.,braces,implantedmedicaldevice, inability/ unwillingness to complete scanning); food allergy that cannot be accommodated through substitutions to the laboratory test snack. Participants with current mood, anxiety, personality, and attentional disorders will be included. Because these psychiatric comorbidities are common among individuals with BN, excluding individuals with these diagnoses would limit the generalizability of the study findings. Methods, Measures, and Procedures Study procedures are outlined in Figure . Visit 1.-Following informed consent procedures, participants with BN will complete the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) , a semi-structured diagnostic and eating disorder assessment measure, with a trained clinical interviewer to confirm BN diagnosis as well as to determine that binge-eating episodes are consistently accompanied by self-induced vomiting. Recruiting individuals with this pattern of BN symptoms will reduce potential heterogeneity (e.g., by excluding individuals who sometimes purge without binge eating or vice versa) and will enable us to examine binge eating and purging as a ""unit"" rather than independently. The EDE will be used to rule out current and past eating disorders among potential non-BN participants and to determine duration of illness among BN participants. In addition, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5; ) will be administered to characterize cooccurring psychopathology including mood, anxiety, and substance-use disorders as well as trauma and PTSD symptoms, and to identify any exclusionary psychiatric disorders. Height and weight will be measured using a digital scale and a stadiometer. Participants will generate a positive and negative mood induction script . For negative mood induction, participants will be asked to provide several examples of times when they ""felt badly"" about themselves, along with a rating (1-10) of how badly they felt They will then be asked to write a detailed description of the event when they felt most badly by re-imagining the experience and remembering the details as vividly as possible . Similar procedures will be followed for the positive mood induction script. In addition, several self-report assessment questionnaires will be administered for sample description and secondary analyses including measures of emotion regulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale ; UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale ), clinical impairment (Clinical Impairment Assessment ), behavioral inhibition (Behavioral Inhibition System/ Behavioral Activation system ), and current psychopathology (Beck Depression Inventory , State Trait Anxiety Inventory ). Visit 2.-Participants will be scheduled for early morning appointments and will be asked to refrain from eating overnight prior to scanning and to abstain from alcohol, drugs, nicotine, and caffeine for 24 h prior to the second visit. Prior to scanning, participants will provide mood ratings on the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)  and practice versions of the in-scanner tasks to familiarize themselves with the procedures. During the fMRI, participants will undergo positive and negative mood induction (counterbalanced) and will complete two tasks (food choice and shopping choice tasks, also counterbalanced) in each condition, resulting in a 2 (group) × 2 (food versus shopping task) design that will be analyzed separately for positive and negative mood conditions. During the mood induction, participants will be instructed to vividly reimagine themselves in the situation that they had written about during Visit 1 (i.e., positive or negative, depending on the condition) while they listen to the researcher reading their script. Using the PANAS, they will rate mood before and after each mood induction, as well as after each task. In between the negative and positive mood conditions, participants will complete a distractor task that involves counting backward in increments of 3 for 60 s to neutralize mood. After scanning procedures, participants will be provided an opportunity to consume a snack selected during the food choice task in privacy and will receive an item viewed during the shopping choice task. Participants will rate mood on the PANAS before and after eating and receiving the item from the shopping task. Participants will then complete a standardized relaxation procedure to reduce any residual negative mood . Participants will receive $100 after the completion of the second visit. fMRI Behavioral Tasks.-To assess the neural correlates of binge-eating and purging anticipation, participants will complete an established food choice task  paired with lossof-control eating instructions while in the scanner. In this task, participants provide ratings indicating preference for consuming one of two presented foods ranging in caloric density and percentage from fat, including ""high-fat"" foods (>30% of calories from fat) that are typical of those consumed during binge-eating episodes. The 8-minute task involves 76 food choices. As in prior investigations, participants will be told that their food selections will determine which food they will be given at a subsequent snack following scanning . However, to avoid participants engaging in restrictive food choices, the instructions will be modified, asking participants to ""let yourself go and eat as much as you want"" during the snack. These instructions have been used in established feeding lab procedures to elicit loss of control binge-eating behavior  in individuals with and without eating disorders. During the snack, participants will be provided with a large portion of one of their highlyrated foods from the food choice task. They will eat in private and have access to a private, unmonitored room/bathroom so that they have the opportunity to binge eat (and, for participants with BN, purge), if desired. They will then be asked to rate (on a scale of 0-5) the extent to which they believed that they had engaged in a binge-eating episode, overeaten, and experienced loss of control. During a comparison shopping task, participants will provide ratings indicating their preference for one of two non-food items $20 in value (e.g., home décor items). The 8-minute task involves 76 item choices. After the scan and snack, they will be provided with an item that they had rated positively during the fMRI shopping task to take home. Neuroimaging Procedures Scanning will be conducted with a 3 Tesla Siemens Prisma scanner at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research at the University of Minnesota. A 32-channel receive only head coil will be used to obtain images for all participants. High-resolution anatomical images will be collected for each participant using a T  Imaging Data Pre-Processing Structural T 1 -and T 2 -weighted data will be pre-processed using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) structural minimum preprocessing stream which includes anatomical parcellation using FreeSurfer . fMRI data will be pre-processed using the HCP fMRI minimum preprocessing stream. Volumes exceeding 0.5 mm of frame-wise displacement from the previous volume will be removed using a confound matrix. fMRI Activation Analysis For each subject, fixed-effects analyses will be conducted to model food choice and shopping using a canonical double-gamma hemodynamic response function with a temporal derivative and local autocorrelation correction. Implicit baseline trials will be left unmodeled to avoid over-specification and incorrectly biasing percent signal change estimates. We will extract average z scores from regions of interest (using FreeSurfer-defined masks for bilateral amygdala, nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) from the food choice versus shopping contrast for subsequent analyses. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) To assess momentary variables, participants with BN will begin 16 days of cell phoneadministered EMA immediately following their fMRI visit. Participants will complete two days of ""practice"" EMA ratings (that will not be used in the analyses) in order to improve data quality and to reduce potential reactivity. EMA data will be collected using the ReTAINE® (Real Time Assessment in the Natural Environment) data management system and will include three types of daily self-report recordings : (a) interval contingent, in which participants complete EMA ratings at designated time intervals; (b) signal contingent, in which participants respond to signals from their EMA device (i.e., participants will be signaled at random five times during the day and evening), and (c) event contingent, in which participants provide EMA recordings in response to a specific event (i.e., before and after eating, binge-eating and purging anticipation event). EMA signal contingent measures include ratings of positive and negative affect using the PANAS  and Profile of Mood States , ratings of overeating and loss of control based on EDE items  to determine binge-eating and vomiting frequency, and questions related to momentary binge-eating and purging anticipation (e.g., To what extent are you thinking about whether or not to binge and purge?"" ""To what extent are you planning a binge-eating and purging episode right now?"" ""To what extent are you planning specific foods to eat in a binge?"" (ratings ). In addition to the $100 they will receive for completing scanning procedures, BN participants will receive $100 after EMA with an additional $50 bonus if they respond to 80% or more of the EMA signals. Statistical Analyses Hypothesis testing will be conducted using multilevel mixed-effects models based upon a general linear or generalized linear model, depending upon distributional requirements. Analyses will be based upon all available data and missing data will not be imputed. Covariates in hypothesis testing will include sex and age. Hypothesis 1.1.-We hypothesize that following negative mood induction, participants with BN will show lower levels of self-reported negative affect, lower levels of activation in regions of the limbic threat network (e.g., amygdala, insula), and greater frontolimbic connectivity during an fMRI food choice task compared to the shopping task. We hypothesize that in contrast, healthy comparison participants will show no differentiation in these responses between tasks after a negative mood induction. A mixed-effects model based upon a general or generalized linear (depending upon distribution of outcome) will be used to compare the effects of group and task (food choice vs shopping task) on self-reported negative affect (PANAS), activation within threat circuit regions of interest, and frontolimbic connectivity in the negative mood induction. Models will include a random intercept, and fixed effects for group, task, and group-by-task interaction, with the test of the hypothesis based upon the interaction. The pre-task affect assessment will be included as a covariate in all affect models. Hypothesis 1.2.-We hypothesize that following positive mood induction, participants with BN will show higher levels of self-reported positive affect, higher levels of activation in regions of the striatal approach network (e.g., nucleus accumbens, caudate), and lower frontostriatal connectivity during an fMRI food choice task compared to the shopping task. We hypothesize that in contrast, healthy comparison participants will show no differentiation in these responses between tasks after positive mood induction. A mixed-effects model will be used to compare the effects of group and task (food choice vs shopping task) on self-reported positive affect (PANAS) and activation in approach circuit regions of interest, and frontostriatal connectivity in the positive mood induction. Models will include a random intercept, and fixed effects for group, task, and group-by-task interaction, with the test of the hypothesis based upon the interaction. Hypothesis 1.3.-We hypothesize that for participants with BN, illness duration will moderate responses to an fMRI food choice task. Specifically, we predict that longer illness duration will be associated with: (a) less negative affect, less activation of the limbic threat network, and more frontolimbic connectivity following the negative mood induction; and (b) more positive affect, more activation of striatal approach regions, and less frontostriatal connectivity following the positive mood induction. Pearson correlations will be calculated to examine the relationship between BN duration, self-reported affect (PANAS), neural activation in threat and approach circuit, regions of interest, and frontolimbic and frontostriatal connectivity in the BN food choice condition separately for each mood state. Hypothesis 2.1.-We hypothesize that the magnitude of EMA negative affect reduction with binge-eating and purging behavior among individuals with BN will be associated with the magnitude of limbic threat network activity and frontolimbic connectivity observed during an fMRI food choice task in the negative mood induction condition. The average magnitude of negative affect pre-to-post change with binge-eating and purging anticipation will be calculated separately for each individual from EMA data. Pearson correlations will be calculated to examine the relationship between the average magnitude of negative affect reduction following binge-eating and purging anticipation as measured by EMA with the magnitude of activity in threat circuit regions of interest and frontolimbic connectivity during the fMRI food choice task in the negative mood condition. Hypothesis 2.2.-We hypothesize that the magnitude of EMA positive affect increase with binge-eating and purging behavior among individuals with BN will be associated with the magnitude of striatal approach network activity and frontostriatal connectivity during an fMRI food choice task in the positive mood induction condition. Similar procedures as those described for Hypothesis 2.1 will be used to examine the association between positive affect and activity in approach circuitry regions of interest and frontostriatal connectivity during the fMRI food choice task in the positive mood condition. Hypothesis 2.3.-We hypothesize that greater EMA binge-eating and purging frequency will correlate with greater magnitude of reductions in negative affect and increases in positive affect associated with binge-eating and purging anticipation as measured by EMA. We also hypothesize that greater EMA binge-eating and purging frequency will correlate with fMRI measures of limbic threat and striatal approach network activity, as well as connectivity among individuals with BN. Frequencies of binge-eating and purging episodes per week will be calculated for each individual from EMA data. Pearson correlations will be calculated between the frequency of binge-eating and purging behavior as measured by EMA, the magnitude of changes in mood as measured by EMA, and frontolimbic and frontostriatal activity/connectivity. Power Analysis Effect size estimates for fMRI comparisons between the BN and non-BN groups are based upon earlier findings  in which the BN group showed greater deactivation across the bilateral amygdala and greater activation averaged across the bilateral caudate during a binge planning task compared to a furniture selection task, with large effect sizes (d > 1.0) observed for these differences. While estimates for negative and positive affect differences between groups are not available, we expect these differences to be much smaller, perhaps in the small-to-medium effect (d = 0.40-0.50) range. Hypotheses 1.1-1.2: The proposed sample size of 60 participants (30 BN, 30 HC) provides a power of 0.87 to detect a group × task interaction with an effect size (d) of 0.40 and a power of 0.97 to detect an effect size of 0.51. Thus, power sh ould be adequate for affect comparisons and excellent for activity/ connection comparisons. Hypothesis 1.3: The proposed sample size of 30 BN participants provides a power of .78 to detect a mood induction-by-BN duration interaction with an effect size of 0.51 and a power of 0.86 to detect an effect size of 0.58. Hypotheses 2.1-2.3: The proposed sample size of 30 BN participants provides a power of 0.81 to detect a bivariate Pearson correlation of 0.50. SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS This proposed study seeks to establish the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms associated with anticipatory reward in BN to support the importance of these processes in the maintenance of BN psychopathology. The specific aims of this study are to examine the impact of anticipatory reward and planning in BN on psychological, affective, and neurobiological reward indices. Specifically, the results of this study will demonstrate the neurobiological correlates of reward anticipation in the context of positive and negative emotions as well as the associations between these neurobiological processes and bulimic behavior in the natural environment. The study findings will also determine the extent to which duration of illness is associated with the magnitude of these psychological and neurobiological processes. Study findings will potentially inform novel treatment targets of anticipated and ""planned"" BN behaviors in existing and novel interventions, particularly the possibility that more distal anticipatory processes can be targeted in addition to more immediate behavioral precipitants. Subsequent applications will determine the extent to which these anticipatory reward processes occur in the varying levels of negative and positive affect, the role of habit and duration of illness and the potential distinctions between the anticipation of binge eating compared to purging.

22,22,Patients at high risk of suicide before and during a COVID-19 lockdown: ecological momentary assessment study,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak may have affected the mental health of patients at high risk of suicide. In this study we explored the wish to die and other suicide risk factors using smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in patients with a history of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. Contrary to our expectations we found a decrease in the wish to die during lockdown. This is consistent with previous studies showing that suicide rates decrease during periods of social emergency. Smartphone-based EMA can allow us to remotely assess patients and overcome the physical barriers imposed by lockdown.,"[""Suicide"", ""suicide attempt"", ""COVID-19"", ""ecological momentary assessment"", ""machine learning""]",10.1192/bjo.2021.43,"Psychiatric patients are particularly vulnerable to the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Social distancing and lockdown measures result in multiple stressors known to increase risk for suicide, including social isolation, financial stress, decreased access to mental healthcare and medical comorbidities.  Research on the mental health consequences of this crisis is considered a priority.  However, quarantine has interfered with face-to-face research. Mobile technology applied to healthknown as mobile health or m-Healthcan overcome these barriers. In this study we use smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to explore the impact of COVID-19 social distancing and lockdown measures on suicide risk, in a sample of psychiatric patients at high risk for suicide. Method The authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008. All procedures involving human patients were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Fundación Jiménez Díaz. All participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study. Participants and procedures Using EMA, we prospectively assessed 36 adult patients, who were being treated at our suicide prevention out-patient clinic because of a high risk of suicide. EMA was delivered using the MEmind smartphone app, which is available for both Android and iOS operating systems. EMA questions were announced as push notifications on users' screens. A detailed description of the MEmind app has been published elsewhere.  Participants were recruited from an ongoing multisite study examining longitudinal risk factors for suicide (SmartCrisis 4 ). Patients were included in the study if they had a history of at least one suicide attempt or an emergency department visit because of suicidal ideation. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Pseudonymization of the participants' personal data was employed, by using a unique identification code for each participant. The follow-up period was divided into: (a) pre-lockdown: 1 October 2019 to 13 March 2020 (before the implementation of Covid-19 lockdown measures); and (b) lockdown: 14 March 14 April 2020. At baseline and at follow-up, patients were administered the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS).  To safeguard the well-being of our patients, upon detecting an alarming level of suicidal ideation (threshold was established at CSSRS suicidal ideation subscale score ≥ 4), their attending psychiatrist was informed, and it was suggested to patients that they attend the emergency department. The EMA questionnaire The EMA questionnaire consists of 32 questions grouped into four areas: wish to die/wish to live (2 questions), sleep (10 questions), negative feelings (13 questions) and appetite (7 questions). Questions were based on the Salzburg Suicide Process Questionnaire.  Supplementary Table  available at https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.43 shows all the questions and their scoring. The MEmind EMA questionnaire has shown good acceptability in preliminary studies.  As constant repetition of questions can place a significant burden on the user, we have incorporated a turn-over system for questions. Out of the pool of 32 questions participants were asked two to four random questions every day, at random times from 10.00 to 22.00 h. Figure  shows the variables explored in the EMA questionnaire and the frequency with which the questions were asked. Statistical analysis We used a machine learning technique, the Indian buffet process (IBP).  The IBP is a non-parametric Bayesian method that reveals latent features through a sparse analysis. Sparsity is defined by the fact that only some of the datapoints will offer discriminant information. Using this method, we can overcome the missing data caused by the turn-over system of the questions. The features revealed by the IBP are supravariables formed by the grouping of variables, that is: sets of variables that tend to adopt certain abnormal values in the same time frame. They are dynamic, and the same person may have different features over time. The values of each of the 32 questions were standardised so that all were expressed from 0 to 1 and the highest value would always express a worse state of mental health. We compared individual suicide risk features before and during the lockdown. Results Mean age of the participants was 41.7 years (s.e. = 16.3). The majority of the participants were women (n = 31; 86.1%). The most common psychiatric diagnosis was mood disorders (n = 21; 58.3%). The mean number of previous suicide attempts was 1.1 (s.e. = 0.2) We identified four suicide risk features that accounted for more than 99.5% of the participants' responses (see Fig. ). Profile 1 is characterised by low values (i.e. low probability of scoring positive) across all 32 suicide risk factors. Profiles 2 and 4 are characterised by a high desire for death, lack of wish to live, decreased appetite and tastelessness of food, and sleep problems; Profile 4 also shows high values for negative emotions. Profile 3 is characterised by lower desire for death, and lower appetite and sleep symptoms, with high values of negative emotions. Before quarantine, the most prevalent feature was Profile 1, with 43.0%. That is, of the 960 responses before quarantine, 43.0% were grouped in Profile 1. The second most prevalent was Profile 3 (26.7%), followed by Profile 2 (17.8%). Profile 4 accounted for 11.8% of the responses and the remaining profiles (5 to 8) accounted for 0.7% (95% CI 0.3-1.5%) of the responses. During the quarantine, the dominant feature continued to be Profile 1 (52.8%). That is, of the 214 responses, 52.8% were grouped around Profile 1. This represents a 22.8% increase. The second most common profile was still Profile 3, with 34.6%. This represents a 29.6% increase. Profile 2 fell to 10.3%, a 42.1% decrease, and Profile 4 fell to 2.3%, an 80.1% decrease. The remaining profiles  were not represented during the quarantine. Results of the χ 2 -test show there are statistically significant differences before v. during lockdown (Profile 1: χ 2 = 6.38, P = 0.012; Profile 2: χ 2 = 6.69, P = 0.010; Profile 3: χ 2 = 5.04, P = 0.025; Profile 4: χ 2 = 16.20, P < 0.001). Discussion Contrary to our expectations, we observed that self-reported suicide risk appeared to decrease during a COVID-19-related lockdown period, in a prospective cohort monitored using smartphone-delivered EMA. Specifically, we found a decrease in the wish to die, and in the rates of appetite and sleep symptoms. Strengths and limitations Strengths of our study include the prospective design and real-time monitoring of dynamic suicide risk using EMA. Our results should be interpreted with caution given the modest sample size. This modest sample size may be the reason why we have found an uneven gender distribution, with over 85% of patients being women. However, in a prior EMA study by our research group we also found a predominance of women in the sample.  Another potential limitation is that we did not ask directly about suicide intent but employed the indirect measure 'wish to die'. However, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis exploring passive suicide ideation found that it was highly similar to active suicide ideation and that it was strongly associated with suicide attempts.  Also, the observation period before lockdown was longer than during lockdown. Finally, the length of the follow-up period was not uniform across the sample.   Pre-lockdown: 1 October 2019 to 13 March 2020 (before the implementation of COVID-19 lockdown measures). Lockdown: 14 March to 14 April 2020. In (a) assessment frequency: a. at least once every 2 weeks during the first month and at least once every 6 weeks afterwards; b. at least twice per week during the first month and at least once per week afterwards. Other studies have also found a decrease in suicidal ideation as a result of COVID-19-related measures. For instance, a recent study showed that internet search queries related to suicide decreased after the USA issued stay-at home-orders.  Although it may seem surprising that suicidal ideation decreases, it is actually consistent with some previous studies showing a drop in suicide rates during periods of social emergency, such as wartime or terrorist attacks.  However, there is also evidence indicating that this decrease may be just temporary: the study by Batty et al (2018)  shows that, although there is a decrease in suicidal behaviour during wartime, just after wars end, suicidal behaviour increases to levels higher than those observed before the war. Thus, during the post-war period, the harmful effects of conflict on an individual's mental health become apparent. In the same way, the possibility exists that there will be an increase in suicidal ideation and behaviour above the expected level once the acute COVID-19 crisis ceases. We must be prepared for this contingency. Implications Continuity of care has been affected by the COVID-19 crisis. In order to minimise the risk of contagion, non-urgent face-to-face consultations have been discontinued in many countries, including Spain. Telemedicine allows us to continue to provide mental healthcare services to our patients. New technologies are already being used to preserve people's mental healthcare during the COVID-19 crisis, for example in the form of online services.  Ensuring access to adequate mental healthcare for vulnerable populations, such as psychiatric patients at high risk for suicide, should remain a priority during times of social emergencies. Smartphone-based monitoring can be used to monitor high-risk populations during social distancing and lockdown periods. "
23,23,Perseverative Cognition in the Positive Valence Systems: An Experimental and Ecological Investigation,"Perseverative cognition (PC) is a transdiagnostic risk factor that characterizes both hypo-motivational (e.g., depression) and hyper-motivational (e.g., addiction) disorders; however, it hasbeen almost exclusively studied within the context of the negative valence systems. The present studyaimed to fill this gap by combining laboratory-based, computational and ecological assessments.Healthy individuals performed the Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT) before and after the inductionof PC or a waiting period. Computational modeling was applied to dissociate the effects of PC onreward sensitivity and learning rate.  Afterwards, participants underwent a one-week ecologicalmomentary assessment of daily PC occurrence, as well as anticipatory and consummatory reward-related behavior. Induction of PC led to increased response bias on the PRT compared to waiting,likely due to an increase in learning rate but not in reward sensitivity, as suggested by computationalmodeling. In daily-life, PC increased the discrepancy between expected and obtained rewards (i.e.,prediction error).  Current converging experimental and ecological evidence suggests that PC isassociated with abnormalities in the functionality of positive valence systems. Given the role of PCin the prediction, maintenance, and recurrence of psychopathology, it would be clinically valuable toextend research on this topic beyond the negative valence systems. ","[""perseverative cognition"", ""positive valence systems"", ""RDoC"", ""probabilistic reward task"", ""ecological momentary assessment"", ""reward prediction error"", ""transdiagnostic psychiatry""]",10.3390/brainsci11050585,"Introduction A transdiagnostic approach in psychiatry promises to overcome the limits of categorial diagnostic classification systems of mental illness and to improve clinical care and treatment . Perseverative cognition (PC ) is a form of cognition characterized by repetitive, intrusive and generally negative (e.g., worrisome and ruminative) thoughts, and it is now recognized as a transdiagnostic factor for the onset, maintenance and recurrence of psychiatric disorders . Different forms of PC are common across distinct neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety disorders , post-traumatic stress disorder , eating disorders , and substance abuse disorders . Despite significant efforts to understand PC both at a psychological and biological level in individuals with and without a psychiatric condition, the mechanisms by which PC contributes to the onset and maintenance of psychopathology remain unclear. A partial explanation stems from the fact that the pathophysiology of PC has been investigated using a specific-disorder approach (e.g., PC in depression ), instead of approaching it as a dimensional and transdiagnostic construct. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), a National Institute of Mental Health proposal linking genetic, neuroscience and behavioral science constructs relevant to psychopathology , is a useful tool to create a cohesive mechanistic understanding of PC. In terms of RDoC, worry and rumination are referred to in the functionality of the negative valence systems domain. Endorsing, recent physiological, neuroimaging, behavioral and clinical data have supported an overlap between PC and several measures of the loss construct . However, as previously noted, PC is also present in disorders such as substance use or in the manic phase of bipolar disorder , pointing to a potential gap in understanding the effect of PC on the positive valence systems domain. Indeed, endorsing a recent proposal for innovation within RDoC to include ""cross-construct patterns of dimensional measurements both across and within different RDoC domains to specify agnostic and possibly transdiagnostic subtypes of psychiatric illnesses"" (page 308, ), it would be important to assess PC-inducing effects on the positive valence systems. In general, the positive valence systems domain involves the regulation of behaviors that result in reward achievement, such as reward responsiveness and learning. A well-validated task to measure reward responsiveness and reward learning included in the RDoC matrix is the Probabilistic Reward Task , which provides an objective assessment of the ability to modulate behavior as a function of prior reinforcement. The PRT has been used across laboratories to provide evidence for acute stress-related blunting of reward responsiveness and reward learning. For example, in early studies, threat of shock-but not negative performance feedback-was found to reduce the ability to modulate behavior as a function of past reward in non-pathological individuals . Given that PC has been conceptualized as a prolonged cognitive and physiological stress response (see  for a meta-analysis), one would expect to observe impaired (i.e., blunted) reward responsiveness and reward learning during episodes of PC. Existing studies on this issue are sparse and limited by the focus on PC as a trait, assessed by retrospective self-report questionnaires. Keeping in mind these limitations, it is noteworthy that such studies all present a somewhat opposite picture. For example, in a study examining the dispositional tendency to ruminate, positive associations between scores on the Rumination Response Scale  and the following were reported: (i) activation of the ventral striatum in response to rewards; and (ii) a ruminative-dependent resting state increased functional connectivity in the cortico-striatal circuits . In an earlier study, the induction of rumination-as opposed to distraction-similarly led to greater sensitivity to reward probabilities, assessed with the Probabilistic Selection Task , in a a group of individuals with depression and controls . It should be noted, however, that, in the study by Erdman et al. , rumination was not experimentally manipulated, thus precluding any causal inference on the effects of PC on the neural responses to rewards. Similarly, in the study by Whitmer et al. , the induction exclusively focused on depressive rumination, rather than on the transdiagnostic construct of PC, and the betweensubjects study design did not allow any inferences about the pre-to post-manipulation changes to be made. The current study sought to investigate the effects of PC on positive valence systems functionality, overcoming the two aforementioned limitations of previous studies. Toward this aim, an experimental study was conducted to investigate the effects of a PC manipulation on behavioral markers of reward responsiveness and reward learning in a sample of psychiatrically healthy individuals. Given the limited generalizability of experimental settings when studying motivational processes and spontaneous phenomenon such as PC, our second goal was to investigate the ability to respond to and learn from rewards during episodes of daily-life PC. To this end, using a mixed design, we first used a well-replicated induction of PC (for a review, see ), which was administered between two PRT assessments in a sample of healthy individuals. Participants were selected to be normally distributed on their levels of dispositional tendency to engage in PC, based on the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ ), which provides a measure of transdiagnostic and content-independent processes underpinning PC. To parse the contribution of learning rate (operationalized as participants' ability to accumulate rewards over time and learn from the reward) and reward sensitivity (operationalized as consummatory pleasure or the immediate behavioral impact of rewards) on PRT performance, a computational model of trial-level performance was also implemented. Then, we adapted a recently developed ecological momentary assessment (EMA ), specifically hypothesized to capture a daily-life motivational system functionality , to study the association between PC and reward processing in everyday life in the same group of participants over a week. Based on the previously reported effects of stress induction on reward-related behavior, we hypothesized that state PC would impair reward responsiveness, as manifested in both the experimental (i.e., impaired performance on the PRT) and the ecological (i.e., reduced momentary reward anticipation and pleasantness) paradigms. Materials and Methods Participants Participants were recruited at undergraduate psychology degree courses, and through word of mouth. They were invited to participate in a study on ""attentional processes, mood and response to rewards"", and were told that they could win up to 30 euros during the experiment. Participants were enrolled after providing a written informed consent to a protocol approved by the Institutional Review board of the Department of Psychology (Ref. N. 740/2020). Exclusionary criteria were history or presence of serious medical or psychiatric conditions and use of drugs/medications. An a priori power analysis was performed with G Power 3  based on the effect size found in previous studies for one of the variables of interest (∆Response Bias). With power of 1 − β > 0.90 and a significance value of p < 0.05, the power analysis revealed that, in a mixed-design with the between-subject factor Group and the within-subject factor Time, an adequate number of participants would be n = 29 per group. In total, 55 healthy participants met eligibility criteria during recruitment. Among them, six participants were excluded from PRT analyses because they did not complete the task post-manipulation. Among the remaining 49, three participants did not pass the quality control check on PRT performance, which was performed blind to group assignment using predefined cut-off scores (see Supplementary Materials). Thus, for the experimental component of the study, data from 46 participants were available for the analysis (35 women, 11 men; 22.96 ± 5.33 years). With regards to the Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) component of the study, exclusion criteria were defined as follows: participants should have provided valid observations: (1) for more than a day; and (2) higher than the 20% of the total e-mailed ""beeps"". Three participants were dropped from these analyses because they did not fulfill both inclusion criteria. Accordingly, the final sample for the EMA study comprised 52 participants (39 women and 13 men). Procedure The study was entirely implemented online, due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. First, participants received the written informed consent, and, once signed, a series of dispositional questionnaires via the survey software Qualtrics (https://www.qualtrics.com, accessed on 29 April 2021). Participants were semi-randomly assigned to the experimental or control groups based on their scores on the PTQ: specifically, PTQ scores were balanced both within and across groups with the same number of participants belonging to each tertile in each group. After filling out the questionnaires, participants were invited to perform an online attention task and an appointment was scheduled. The Millisecond version of the PRT was adapted following the authors' guidelines and administered via Inquisit Web (https://www.millisecond.com/products/inquisit6/weboverview.aspx, accessed on 29 April 2021), a tool to collect behavioral data remotely (see Supplementary Materials). An Inquisit script was programmed to start with the assessment of mood and baseline levels of PC, by the use of Visual-Analog Scales (VASs). Then, all participants underwent two sessions of the PRT (mouth and nose version), before and after a 2-min induction of PC (experimental group) or a 2-min wait (control group). Assessment of mood and PC were repeated after the experimental manipulation, and again at the end of the second PRT. This session was followed by a 7-day ecological momentary assessment. After one week, participants were fully debriefed and compensated for participation with the money that they won during the task. Questionnaires All participants completed a set of questions assessing sociodemographic and lifestyle or medical information (i.e., nicotine, alcohol and caffeine consumption and medication intake). To obtain a measure of dispositional tendency to engage in some forms of PC, participants were administered the PTQ , a 15-item questionnaire developed to capture the processes typical of repetitive thinking instead of the specific content of thoughts, namely repetitiveness (e.g., ""The same thoughts keep going through my mind again and again""), intrusiveness (e.g., ""Thoughts come to my mind without me wanting them to""), difficulties in disengaging (e.g., ""I can't stop dwelling on them""), unproductiveness (e.g., ""I keep asking myself questions without finding an answer""), and mental capacity absorbing (e.g., ""My thought prevent me from focusing on other things""). Additional dispositional traits were assessed to control for potential between-groups baseline differences: (a) Behavioral inhibition and behavioral activation Scale (BIS/BAS ), Cronbach's alpha in the present sample = 0.73; (b) Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11 ), Cronbach's alpha in the present sample = 0.83; (c) Snaith-Hamilton pleasure scale (SHAPS ), Cronbach's alpha in the present sample = 0.84; (d) State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; ), Cronbach's alpha in the present sample = 0.93; (e) Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D ), Cronbach's alpha in the present sample = 0.72; (f) Optimism scale ; and (g) Sensation Seeking Scale V , Cronbach's alpha in the present sample = 0.91. Perseverative Cognition Induction A well-replicated verbal induction procedure designed to induce PC was used (see  for a systematic review). Specifically, participants were asked to tell the experimenter (for 2 min) about a negative personal episode that happened within the past year that made them feel sad, anxious, or stressed and-when thinking about it-still made them sad, anxious, or stressed or something that may happen in the future that worried them (see Supplementary Materials). Participants in the control group were asked to wait until the next instructions (2 min). Visual-Analog Scales Visual-Analog Scales (VAS) were administered at the beginning of the protocol (VAS 1), after performance on the first PRT (VAS 2), after the induction (VAS 3), and after performance on the second PRT (VAS 4) to assess manipulation effects on self-reported momentary mood and levels of state PC. Momentary mood was assessed by the questions ""In this moment how much do you feel: happy/anxious/satisfied/sad/energetic"". To assess levels of state PC before and after the induction or control condition, participants were asked ""In this moment how much do you feel"" (1) ""distracted by thoughts/past memories/future worries/personal problems""; and (2) ""stuck on these thoughts/past memories/future worries/personal problems without being able to think about anything else?"" Probabilistic Reward Task The PRT is a task designed to yield an objective measure of participants' ability to modify their behavior as a function of a reward and provides objective measure of reward responsiveness and reward learning . On each trial, participants were asked to decide whether a long or short stimulus (mouth or nose) was presented (for 100 ms) on a cartoon face by pressing one of two fixed buttons on the keyboard (""E"" and ""I""). Importantly, and in line with previous studies in healthy participants (e.g., ), the difference between the two stimuli was very subtle (10-11 mm for the mouth version and 5-5.31 mm for the nose version). Of note, and unbeknownst to the participants, one stimulus (called ""rich stimulus"") was rewarded more frequently compared to the other (called ""lean stimulus""), according to a 3-to-1 asymmetrical reinforcement ratio in favor of the rich stimulus (see Supplementary Materials for more detailed information). Thus, reward learning is implicit and based on the reinforcement history rather than on the perceptual differences between the two stimuli. Each participant completed the task twice: before and after a PC induction or waiting. To reduce carry-over effects between conditions (pre-post), the mouth and nose versions of the PRT were utilized, before and after the experimental manipulation, respectively (i.e., not counterbalanced across subjects). The target of the asymmetrical reinforcement ratio and the button on keyboard to press for long or short stimulus were counterbalanced within and between participants for a total of four different combinations. Data Reduction According to signal detection theory, the main variables of interest were: (1) response bias, an empirically derived measure of systematic preference to choose the most frequently rewarded stimulus; and (2) discriminability, which provides a control measure of participants' ability to discriminate between the two stimuli and reflects task difficulty. According to an established procedure , response bias (log b) and discriminability (log d) were calculated, respectively, as: logb = 1 2 log (RICHcorrect + 0.5) × (LEANincorrect + 0.5) (RICHincorrect + 0.5) × (LEANcorrect + 0.5) , logd = 1 2 log (RICHcorrect + 0.5) × (LEANcorrect + 0.5) (RICHincorrect + 0.5) × (LEANincorrect + 0.5) , where RICHcorrect and RICHincorrect are the number of the correct and incorrect responses to the rich stimulus, respectively, and LEANcorrect and LEANincorrect are those to the lean stimulus. As evidenced in Equation ( ), a higher response bias results from a larger numerator (i.e., larger number of rich correct and lean incorrect) or from a smaller denominator (i.e., smaller number of rich correct and lean correct). As done in previous studies using this task , 0.5 was added to each variable to make the calculation of the response bias and discriminability possible in cases in which one of the raw cells was equal to 0. To further evaluate behavioral responses, the percentage of correct responses (i.e., accuracy) for each stimulus (rich or lean) type was calculated. Computation Modeling of PRT A series of reinforcement learning models were fitted to participants' trial-by-trial data according to previously established procedures (see  for details). The 'Stimulus-Action' model treated both stimuli as being completely distinct and associated rewards with stimulus-action pairs. In the 'Action' model, subjects were assumed to neglect the stimuli and only learned action values when forming expectations. Another model, 'Belief', proposed that rewards were associated with a mixture of two stimulus-action associations weighted by an uncertainty factor. Lastly, a 'Punishment' model evaluated whether zero rewards were regarded as aversive losses. Expectation-maximization  was utilized to derive group priors in these models and individual Laplace approximation of posterior distributions was used to estimate parameters for every subject (see Supplementary Methods). Model comparisons were conducted via integrated group-level Bayesian Information Criterion factors. The most parsimonious account of the data was provided by the 'Action' model, with a group-level log Bayes factor compared to second-best 'Belief' model of 68 (which represents very strong evidence). This approach allowed two main parameters to be derived: reward sensitivity, which assessed the immediate behavioral impact of rewards (mean = 0.887, SD = 0.349), and learning rate (mean = −5.17, SD = 1.52), which measured ability to learn from rewards accumulated over time. Note that parameters were computed in the transformed space in order to prevent issues with non-Gaussianity. Hence, learning rate is no longer constrained to the range of 0-1 and reward sensitivity no longer constrained to range of 0 to +inf. Instead, both parameters are unconstrained from -inf to +inf, but larger values still indicate greater learning rate and reward sensitivity. Two other parameters that are not the focus of this study were also obtained: instruction sensitivity (mean = 0.167, SD = 0.778) and initial bias (mean = −0.018, SD = 0.209). EMA To measure reward responsiveness during daily life events of PC, an ecological momentary assessment with a time-contingent design  was implemented in Qualtrics. An array of emails was scheduled to arrive at unpredictable moments about every 120 min, between 10:00 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. for a period of 7 days (i.e., 7 e-mails per day). Each e-mail had a link to an electronic diary which took about 2-3 min to be filled in. The diary was available for a maximum of 20 min from the initial notification, but participants were asked to fill out the questions as soon as possible to reduce recall bias. EMA Measures The items were created to measure the processes underlying PC (intensity, intrusiveness, repetitiveness and stuck), rather than the specific content of the perseverative thoughts . Participants had to rate on a 7-point Likert scale (from Not at all to Very much): (1) ""Right now, how much were you distracted by your thoughts (i.e., past memories, future worries, personal problems)?""; (2) ""How much were these thoughts going through your mind again and again?""; (3) ""How much were these thoughts coming to your mind without you wanting them to?""; and (4) ""How much were you stuck on certain issues and could not move on?"". Due to the high correlation between Items 2 and 3, Item 3 was dropped and the final PC composited was obtained by summing the three scores (Items 1, 2, and 4) per participant and time point of assessment. According to one of the few previous studies on reward-related behavior in daily life , probabilistic reward-related behavior was measured on a 7-point Likert scale (from Not at all to Very much) by questions assessing: (1) Reward anticipation, ""Think about what you consider to be the most rewarding situation in the next hour. . . How much are you looking forward to it?""; (2) Effort, ""How much effort are you willing to exert to make it happen?""; and (3) Activity pleasantness, ""Think about what you were doing right before receiving the email. . . How much did you feel actively engaged in such activity?"" ""How much were you enjoying it?"". As above for PC, composite for Activity Pleasantness was created by summing the scores of their relative items per participants and time point of assessment. Data Analysis 2.10.1. Experimental Session Preliminary evaluations were conducted to ensure no violation of the assumptions of normality, linearity, homogeneity of variances, and sphericity. Series of independent sample t and χ 2 tests were performed to exclude the presence of pre-existing socio-demographic (age, sex, medication use, and smoking), dispositional (scores on the questionnaires), and affective state (scores on the VAS at baseline) differences between the two groups. To evaluate the efficacy of the induction procedure in eliciting PC, change scores were computed using scores on the VAS post-manipulation (VAS 3) minus scores premanipulation (VAS 2) and performing a series of independent sample t-tests. Then, to test whether the effects of the induction continued throughout performance on the second PRT, change scores were computed using scores on the VAS at the end of the protocol (VAS 4) minus post-manipulation scores (VAS 3) and a series of independent sample t-tests were performed. Two General Linear Models (GLMs), with Block (Block 1, Block 2, Block 3) and Time (pre, post) as within-subject variables and Group (experimental, control) as a betweensubject variable, were computed separately on response bias and discriminability. For accuracy, the GLM also included the within-subjects Stimulus Type (lean, rich). Then, to assess the magnitude of change in reinforcement learning before and after the experimental manipulation, a GLM with Time (pre, post) and Group (experimental, control) was run on ∆Response Bias, computed as Response Bias during Block 3 minus Response Bias during Block 1, as in previous studies (see, e.g., ). Lastly, two separate GLMs with Time and Group were performed on computational parameters of reward sensitivity and learning rate. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) First, we evaluated empirically the missing data mechanisms underlying the final dataset. For this purpose, we performed the classical Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) test  at different levels of analysis: within subjects, between subjects, within days and between days. The MCAR test evaluate the null hypothesis that data are missing completely at random. In line with , we set a p-value < 0.05 for rejecting the MCAR basic assumption. If this assumption can be retained for all levels of analysis, substantive models can be reasonably analyzed by handling missing data with the Full Information Maximum Likelihood approach (FIML ). Consistent with our theory, we tested an ESM (multilevel) path analytic model. This model was tested with Mplus 8.5 . At the within (daily fluctuations) level, the time-lagged PC (PC t−1 ) was specified as associated with Reward Anticipation t−1 and both variables, in turn, predicting the unlagged version of Activity Pleasantness (Activity Pleasentness t ). Moreover, Activity Pleasantness t was controlled for previous levels of the same variable (Activity Pleasantness t−1 ), but also for minutes to midnight associated with each time point of assessment as an additional time-varying covariate. Moreover, the interaction between PC t−1 and Reward Anticipation t−1 and PC t−1 and Activity Pleasantness t−1 in explaining Activity Pleasantness t . All independent variables and Activity Pleasantness t−1 were previously centered around the participant mean (see ), and the scores of the last time point of daily assessment of the lagged variables were not allowed to predict the first score in Activity Pleasantness t of the subsequent day (see ). At the between level (subjects), intercepts of dependent variables and slopes were treated as random, and the between-level covariance matrix was set to unstructured. Results Descriptives As shown in Table , the two groups did not differ for any of the examined baseline sociodemographic, dispositional and state variables.  Efficacy of the Experimental Manipulation The independent sample t-tests revealed significant group differences for state levels of: (1) PC (t (41) = 2.79, p = 0.008, d = 0.87); (2) being stuck (t (41) = 3.07, p = 0.004, d = 0.96); and (3) being sad (t (41) = 2.62, p = 0.012, d = 0.82). There was a stronger increase from preto post-manipulation in all these variables in the experimental compared to the control group (see Figure ). When we evaluated whether these effects were prolonged until the end of the second PRT, no significant group differences emerged, indicating no changes in any of the examined variables from post-manipulation to the end of the protocol.   Total accuracy showed main effect of Time (F (1, 44) = 79.54, p < 0.0001, η p 2 = 0.33), with reduced overall accuracy during performance on the second PRT in both groups (d = 1.31, CI = 0.12, 0.19, p < 0.0001) (see Figure ). No main effect of Group or significant interactions (F (1, 46) = 0.47, p = 0.50) emerged (see Supplementary Materials for further control analyses). Computational Modeling The two-way GLM on learning rate yielded a significant main effect of Time (F (1, 44) = 21.76, p < 0.0001, η p 2 = 0.33) and a marginally significant Time X Group interaction (F (1, 44)   EMA MCAR tests were not statistically significant for all levels of analysis, suggesting that missing data were unrelated to the study variables, specific days and time points of assessment for all participants. Thus, the following ESM path analytic model was tested by handling missing data with the FIML approach and by using robust maximum likelihood estimators (MLR; see ). Since after a first model run all random slopes parameters were not statistically significant, they were all fixed to zero. Considering the high level of correlation between self-reported levels of Reward anticipation and Effort (r = 0.944; p < 0.001), a composite score (from now on referred to as Reward Anticipation) was created by summing the scores of their relative items per participants and time point of assessment. Model fit with observed data was close to perfect: MLRχ 2 = 1.890 (df=4) , p = 0.756; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0: Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 1.00; Tucker-Lewis Index or Non-normed Fit Index (TLI or NNFI) = 1.00; within-level  Specifically, an increase in time-lagged PC t−1 was significantly and negatively associated with time-lagged Reward Anticipation t−1 . Activity Pleasantness t was significantly and positively predicted by the time-lagged version of the same variable and Reward Anticipation t−1 , while it was significantly but negatively predicted by PC t−1 . Moreover, the stable (between-subjects) components of the time-lagged version of Reward Anticipation and Activity Pleasantness were significantly and positively correlated. Finally, the interaction between time-lagged PC and Activity Pleasantness and PC and Reward Anticipation in predicting Activity Pleasantness were both significant and negative. Specifically, low levels of PC t−1 produced an additional increase in Activity Pleasantness t scores under conditions of, respectively, high Reward Anticipation t−1 and Activity Pleasantness t−1 . Discussion To date, PC has been almost exclusively studied within the negative valence systems. This is somehow surprising if we consider that PC is now recognized as a transdiagnostic factor, which is present across psychiatric disorders, such as substance use disorder or in the manic phase of bipolar I disorder (e.g., ). To fill this gap, and in line with a recent call to study transdiagnostic factors both across and within different RDoC domains , the present study combined an experimental paradigm with experience sampling in daily life with the goal of providing an ecologically valid view of the effects of PC on reward learning. To do so, in the experimental session, we used a task designed to objectively assess participants' ability to modulate behavior as a function of reward  before and after the induction of PC. Perseverative Cognition, Stress Response and Reward Functionality Contrary to our hypotheses, results point to a higher response bias toward the most frequently rewarded stimulus in the experimental compared to the control group, suggesting that PC enhanced reward responsiveness and the ability to shape future behavioral choices based on prior reinforcement experiences. Considering that PC is usually associated with a significant physiological stress-response (i.e., fight or flight) (see  for a meta-analysis), the current finding is somehow inconsistent with previously reviewed results on the effects of an acute stressor (e.g., threat of shocks) on reward responsiveness, where stress-related blunted reward responsiveness and reward learning have been reported . This discrepancy might have occurred due to differences in stress paradigms such as type of induction (e.g., threat-of-shock and PC induction) and in stress-to-task latency (e.g., during the task and just before the task). For example, relative to the type of induction, Ottaviani and colleagues  noted that the physiological correlates (e.g., systemic cortisol release) of PC and acute stressor are different in terms of quantity and duration. Although the magnitude of the effect of acute stress is greater in terms of physiological activation, PC activates the body more frequently and for longer time, making the existence of different pathways to alteration of reward processing functionality possible. Relative to stress-to-task latency, different cellular and neuroendocrine dynamics occur on the ground of stressor onset (e.g., ). Indeed, administering the reward learning task just before-instead of during-the stress manipulation seems to be associated with an increase in reinforcement learning . Notably, in the current study, the PRT was administered immediately after the induction and the subjective effects of PC induction are maintained until the end of the task, as shown by the visual-analog scales. It is also important to note that our finding of a potentiated effect of PC on reward functionality is not without precedents. Whitmer and colleagues  found that a depressive rumination induction just before the probabilistic reward selection task, a reinforcement learning task similar to the PRT, led to a higher sensitivity to reward relative to a distraction induction in both clinically depressed and healthy individuals. Moreover, the dispositional tendency to ruminate was found to be positively associated with activation of the ventral striatum regions and increased connectivity within cortico-striatal circuits in response to rewards . This finding is somewhat contrary to results of a recent meta-analysis of positive valence system functionality in depressive patients, where the largest impairment emerged precisely in the subconstruct of reward learning . In an attempt to understand whether the greater reward bias triggered by PC was due to the effect of learning rate (i.e., the ability to learn from reward feedback) or to reward sensitivity (i.e., the hedonic immediate behavioral impact of rewards), a computational modeling analysis was performed (e.g., ). The computational modeling highlighted a marginally significant contribution of learning rate (of large effect size) and a non-significant effect of reward sensitivity to the effects of PC on reward processing. Such parameters were derived from the mathematical models of reinforcement learning . Specifically, learning rate quantifies the extent to which reward prediction errors (i.e., the difference between the obtained and expected reward) affect learning, specifically the speed to which reward affects behavior . This implies that PC may increase the behavioral impact of prior reward feedback on the current trial-by-trial decision and thus learning in function of prior reinforcements without a concomitant increase of hedonic impact of rewards. In line with the current finding, evidence suggests that acute stress has dissociable effects on the distinct components of reward processing, particularly potentiating motivation/'wanting' during the anticipatory phase of reward processing, while reducing 'liking' during the consummatory phase (reward receipt/delivery phase). For example, an acute stress manipulation in the form of performance negative feedback (thought to elicit PC), increased neural and behavioral activation in the anticipatory phase of reward assessed by monetary incentive delay task, designed for the simultaneous measurement of the anticipation and consumption phase of reward processing . Consistently, the dispositional tendency to engage in rumination (i.e., trait rumination) positively correlated with activation of the areas implicated in the salience network to reward-but not to loss-cues in the anticipatory phase of reward processing, after controlling for age, sex, and depressed mood . In the context of more basic investigations, a multitude of animal studies  and some human studies  suggest that acute stress manipulation, possible through an increase of brain levels of glucocorticoids and catecholamines , quickly activates mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic neurons  which in turn potentiates cue-triggering wanting, attentional orienting toward salient events and learning from behavioral reinforcements . Perseverative Cognition and Daily-Life Motivational System Functionality A more ecological assessment of behaviors and cognition outside the laboratory has been called for to draw more valid conclusions on mental health functioning . In line with this, we combined an ecological assessment of daily-life occurrence of the cognitive processes underling PC with the measurement of everyday reward-related behavior, to enhance the validity and understanding of laboratory results. Interestingly, the momentary occurrence of PC modulated the association between the anticipation of a reward and the concurrent tendency to be actively engaged with and satisfied by such reward. In other words, in moments when participants were stuck in their thoughts, they appeared to be less sensitive to rewards value even when they had been showing high levels of anticipation and motivation to pursue them. Such an observed decoupling between the anticipation and the consummatory phase of reward processing during episodes of PC generates a discrepancy between the expected and obtained reward, that is a prediction error. Considering that learning rate, as assessed by the applied computational modeling, particularly incorporates measures of prediction error , it is plausible that the laboratory finding of an increased learning rate during performance on the PRT following PC might derive from an increase in reward prediction error. This interpretation would be consistent with the common idea that maladaptive PC comes from a recurrent and unfruitful attempt to reduce the discrepancies between actual and desired goals . If PC exacerbates such discrepancy, as suggested by both current laboratory and ecological results, this could be a mechanism through which this maladaptive process is pathogenically maintained. In support of this speculative hypothesis, Ditcher and colleagues  found greater reward network activation during the anticipatory phase of reward processing paired with reward network hypoactivation during reward outcomes in individuals with major depression; in interpreting such results, the authors point to the role of rumination. Besides potentiating reward-related prediction error, when the anticipatory and the consummatory phases of reward were examined separately, daily occurrence of PC had the effect to dampen each of these components. Notably, the occurrence of PC not only reduced the hedonic value of a concomitant reward but also buffered the positive effect of such reward on the subsequent one. This is well in line with the fact that depressed patients who are characterized by higher levels of PC are more prone to relapse after psychological or pharmacological treatment . Limitations and Conclusions The current results should be interpreted with due consideration of the limitations of the study. First, data were collected by setting up a remote experimental session due to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Noteworthy, the required methodological rigor was maintained by having the experimenter connected online throughout the experimental protocol. However, extra-experimental environmental variables, such as performing the task with one's personal computer, may have biased the results. In regard to this, we decided not to use reaction times as a control variable of the behavioral output of the PRT. The analysis of the reaction times could have informed us on the speed of choice of the stimulus that guided the learning, therefore providing further indication on the development of bias in the two groups. Despite this, the specificity of the measurement of the response bias was supported by control analysis such as the analysis of discrimination and accuracy. Second, it is possible that the historical period during which the study was performed could have influenced some of the EMA variables, for example the assessment of rewardrelated behavior during times of limited freedom. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread increases in mental health problems, including anxiety and depression, and this might have intensified the daily occurrence and severity of PC episodes. Even though we have no reasons to expect that the global health situation has specifically affected the association between PC and reward-related behaviors, it would be important to replicate the EMA results on different samples after the end of the pandemic. Third, the sample size is limited, mostly composed of university students, and unbalanced with regards to gender distribution. Given the well-known gender differences in the tendency to develop hypo-motivational (e.g., depression) and hyper-motivational (e.g., addiction) disorders, future studies should investigate the moderating role of gender on the association between daily PC and reward-based learning. To conclude, the experimental induction of PC in the laboratory potentiated rewardbased learning, and ecological data suggest that this may derive from potentiated reward prediction error, due to a PC-induced decoupling between the anticipatory and consummatory phase of reward. Together with the negative consequences on the consummatory phase of reward, likely leading to a long-lasting reduced hedonic impact of rewards value, the hereby reported effects on prediction error may inform maintenance mechanisms. For example, it has been shown that PC may render individuals more prone to engage in unhealthy habitual behaviors, such as food or alcohol binge intake . Present data advise not only toward treating PC as a dimensional and transdiagnostic construct  but also toward the implementation of ad hoc interventions to normalize positive valence systems (dis)functionality. To maximize the clinical application of current findings and gather a more mechanistic understanding, it would be important to investigate neurobiological alterations underpinning reward processing dysfunctions during PC. Alterations within mesocorticolimbic circuits, commonly thought to be implicated in reward processes and in motivational deficits in psychiatric disorders, have not been specifically associated with PC. However, emerging evidence exists, pointing to alterations in corticostriatal functioning associated with both state and trait PC . In line with the proposal of Kalivas and Kalivas , further investigations of the corticostriatal involvement in the maintenance of PC and its effects on reward-related behavior could forecast therapeutic impact on many disorders, all afflicted by this maladaptive symptom.

24,24,"Predictors of unplanned drinking in daily life: The influence of context, impulsivity, and craving in those with emotion dysregulation","Objective: Unplanned drinking, or drinking that violates intentions, has been linked to significant alcohol-related consequences; however, little is known about what factors within individuals daily lives predict whether un-planned drinking occurs. This  study examines the  influence of daily-life impulsivity, alcohol craving, and interpersonal contexts on unplanned drinking. Method: Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data were collected from 32 moderate drinkers. Participants were prompted six times per day for up to 21 days. Each morning participants reported whether they planned to drink that day. Multilevel and GEE models predicted drinking behaviors on days without intent to drink from daily-life interpersonal contexts, and pre-drinking ratings of impulsivity and craving. Results: Spending time in a bar and spending relatively more time with other people on days with no intention to drink was associated with drinking. Individuals who experienced higher craving prior to drinking were relatively more likely to engage in unplanned drinking. When participants reported relatively greater difficulties with premeditation, they were more likely to subsequently report initiating an unplanned drinking episode. Results also suggest that individuals generally higher on negative urgency may be less likely to engage in unplanned drinking but drink more when they do. Conclusion: These results indicate the influence of daily-life contexts, craving, and impulsivity on unplanned drinking behavior. We highlight several possible avenues for intervention and prevention efforts including modifying social and interpersonal environments, screening for craving patterns, and targeting cognitive deficits in planning.","[""Alcohol"", ""Unplanned drinking"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Craving"", ""Contexts""]",10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.106901,"Introduction Unplanned alcohol use, or drinking behavior that violates drinking intentions, is a relatively common behavior, with 16%  to 40%  of reported drinking occasions being unplanned. Importantly, some evidence suggests unplanned alcohol use relates to additional negative consequences beyond that seen in planned alcohol use , particularly for unplanned episodes of heavy drinking. These studies suggest that the lack of planning inherent in unplanned drinking may convey some unique risk for negative alcohol-related consequences. Conversely, another study found that unplanned drinking was related to relatively fewer negative consequences compared to planned drinking . This discrepancy may be due to the fact that  investigated any unplanned drinking while the other researchers examined heavy unplanned drinking specifically, suggesting that consequences may be more related to heavy unplanned drinking. Most of the research to date on unplanned drinking has focused on its consequences; as such, little is known about the predictors of unplanned drinking in daily life. That is, are there certain contexts or factors within a day that may reliably influence whether one violates the intention to not drink later that day? Although momentary and aggregate experiences of positive affect appear unrelated to unplanned drinking , individuals higher in trait-level urgency, lack-of-planning, and delay discounting are more likely to report intending to drink which in turn predicted daily alcohol consumption . The question remains regarding what factors within a day influence whether a person violates plans to not drink. Studying predictive factors within individuals' daily lives has clear and obvious implications for both the assessment of unplanned drinking as well as for prevention and intervention. For example, if we can identify factors that influence a person to ultimately violate their intention to not drink, then intervention targeting those factors may prevent the individual from engaging in unplanned drinking and experiencing related consequences. To address this, the current study tested the influence of daily-life impulsivity, craving, and interpersonal contexts on drinking behavior on days without intention to drink within a clinical sample. Impulsivity , craving , and specific contexts  have all shown significant relations to general drinking in past daily-life research, so here we tested their relation to unplanned drinking specifically. Although trait-level research has not revealed significant links between impulsivity and unplanned drinking (e.g., , state-level facets of impulsivity have shown differential predictive relationships with drinking behavior in daily life above and beyond that attributed to traits . Past daily-life studies have also found that drinking most often occurred at home and in bars, and when spending time with other people . Consequently, we hypothesized that higher levels of impulsivity, time spent in normative drinking contexts (e.g., with others, in a bar), and greater craving would predict drinking on days when participants reported no intention to drink. Existing studies have only assessed predictors of unplanned drinking in college-age drinkers, where influences on the decision to engage in unplanned drinking may differ systematically from community or clinical samples of adults. To address this, we examined predictors of unplanned drinking in a clinical sample of adults, recruited from outpatient clinics as a part of a larger study focused on emotion dysregulation and alcohol use. Emotion dysregulation has shown a consistent relationship with problematic alcohol use , so this sample was appropriate to address our current research question. Method Participants We recruited 37 participants aged 18-45 who reported consuming alcohol at least twice a week on average. As part of a larger parent study, participants also met criteria for a current psychiatric disorder characterized by dysregulated mood (i.e., current mood, anxiety, or borderline personality disorder), confirmed via semi-structured interview. Participants were excluded from the study if they were pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant, had a history of head trauma, or were currently in treatment for alcohol related problems. Data from days where participants reported no intention to drink were included in analyses; 32 participants reported at least one day where they did not plan to drink. Participants were 81% female (n = 26) with an average age of approximately 24 years old (SD = 5.10). Participants primarily identified as white (91%; Black/African American: 9%) and three percent identified as Hispanic/Latinx. In total, these participants provided 2,210 reports over the 371 days with no plans to drink. Participant compliance with morning and random prompts was excellent, averaging 82%. Procedure All study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board and all participants provided informed consent prior to enrollment in the study. After screening for eligibility and completing diagnostic interviews, participants completed baseline self-report measures and were trained to use the data collection application (app) on their smartphones. Participants were loaned a smartphone if they did not own one. EMA protocol Participants completed up to 21 days of EMA surveys via the smartphone app. Participants were prompted to complete morning reports each day of the study after waking (but prior to 12:00 pm). On average morning reports were completed at approximately 9:30AM. Participants were then notified six times per day to complete random prompts, which were scheduled at least 60 min apart. Participants were also instructed to complete user-initiated drinking reports after finishing their initial drink of a drinking episode, and follow-up drinking assessments were administered 30, 60, 120, and 180 min after recording an initial drink. Follow-up assessments were extended 60 min for each subsequent drink logged. Measures Alcohol Craving and Consumption Participants indicated on each morning report if they planned to consume alcohol that day (""Do you plan on drinking today or tonight?""). At all prompts, participants were asked the degree to which they craved alcohol in the past 15 min (1 = not at all to 5 = extremely), whether they had consumed alcohol since the previous prompt, and if so, how many standard drinks they had consumed. For these analyses, only craving ratings provided before participants began drinking each day were included. Impulsivity State-level impulsivity was assessed on all EMA prompts, using four items based on each of the four UPPS subscales . Participants were asked the degree to which they endorsed the items within the past 15 min from 1 = very slightly or not at all to 5 = extremely. Items included ""I felt and acted on a strong impulse"" (negative urgency), ""I did something without really thinking about it"" (lack of premeditation), ""I gave up easily"" (lack of perseverance), and ""I did something for the thrill of it"" (sensation seeking). These items previously have shown to be valid indicators of UPPS facets and differentially related to alcohol use in daily life . As with craving reports, only impulsivity reports provided before participants began drinking were included in analyses. Contexts At each prompt, participants indicated their current location (work, bar/restaurant, home, other public location 1 , other). Based on prevalence rates in our sample and prior work showing that being at bars strongly predicts alcohol consumption , we only included home and bar/restaurant in our analyses. Participants also indicated who they had spent time with in the past 15 min (romantic partner, friend/acquaintance, another family member, or someone else). For these analyses, we created a dichotomous with others (versus alone if none of the options were selected) variable. Analytic plan All analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4. As mentioned, only data from days where participants reported no intention to drink were included in these analyses (n = 371 aggregate days across 32 participants) 2 . Analyses included a total of 2210 prompts completed by participants on these days with no intended drinking (assessed via participants' response on the morning report). Participants included in these analyses completed an average of 69 prompts (SD = 28.10) across days without intention to drink, or an average of 3.4 prompts per day (SD = 2.75). Though the number of participants in this study is somewhat small, our analyses are adequately powered (power ≥ 0.80) to detect medium to large effects at the moment-and day-levels, and large effects (minimum detectable effect size > 0.5) at the person-level . In all models, day-level aggregates were centered on person averages of pre-drinking values. Person-level aggregate variables were centered on sample means. The bar context variable was heavily skewed, with roughly 41% of participants reporting spending no time at a bar over the course of the study; this variable was therefore entered as a dichotomous variable at both the day-and person-levels. The other two context variables (with others, at home) were entered as proportion scores and transformed by multiplying the proportion by 100 to improve interpretability of the effect size. Day-level variables represent the percentage of the day spent with others or at home, while person-level variables represent the percentage of all prompts in the study when participants endorsed spending time with others or being at home. All models also included gender, whether it was a weekend day, age, and day in the study as covariates. Two-level generalized estimating equation (GEE) models predicting dichotomous drinking (Y/N) on days with no drinking intention were conducted using PROC GENMOD. Additional two-level models predicting total amount consumed on unplanned drinking days were constrained to instances where individuals did drink on days without intention to drink (75 data points from 26 individuals). Those models were conducted using PROC GLIMMIX specifying a Poisson distribution. This distribution was chosen since the outcome is a count variable and was appropriate according to fit statistics (chi-square/df = 0.98). Because of the restricted sample, these analyses were powered to detect medium-to-large effect sizes at the day-level (minimum detectable effect approximately 0.33; . We also ran post hoc analyses predicting momentary drink initiation on days with no reported plans to drink. The two-level model described above predicting whether or not someone drank alcohol examines the factors on a given day that influence drinking. In contrast, the post-hoc analyses focused on the moments surrounding the first drink participants consumed on any given day with no reported intention to drink. This three-level model (moments nested in days nested in people) predicting drink initiation (Y/N) was also conducted with PROC GENMOD and was restricted to pre-drinking and drink initiation moments. For this model, reports after the first drink (during and following drinking episodes) were not included. Momentary ratings of impulsivity and craving were centered on pre-drinking day-level means. Lagged variables were also entered, which represent participant responses at the previous prompt. Dichotomous responses for momentary and lagged context variables were also included as predictors, indicating whether participants were in at a bar, at home, or with other people at the prompt when they initiated drinking as well as whether they reported being in these contexts at the previous prompt, respectively. Results Participants reported consuming alcohol on 20% of days they reported no intent to drink (n = 75 days), consistent with rates of unplanned drinking reported in other studies . When participants reported drinking, they reported drinking 4 or more drinks approximately 40% of the time (on n = 30 days). On average, participants drank 3.5 drinks (SD = 2.51) when they engaged in unplanned drinking. Table  reports frequencies and descriptives of primary study variables. The left-hand section of columns in Table  presents the results of the GEE model predicting drinking (yes/no) on days with no drink intention from day-and person-level impulsivity scores, craving, and context variables. Results show that spending any time in a bar and relatively more time with other people on a day without drinking intention increased the odds of drinking that day. Individuals who experienced relatively higher craving prior to drinking were also more likely to drink that day. Conversely, individuals higher in negative urgency across the EMA period were significantly less likely to drink compared to others. Spending time in a bar at the person-level also increased the likelihood of drinking. The right-hand section of columns of Table  presents the results from the model predicting how much individuals drank when they did drink on unplanned drinking days. Participants who reported experiencing greater urgency, lower sensation seeking, and more time with other people over the study period reported drinking relatively more when they did drink on unplanned drinking days. Table  presents the effects from the model predicting momentary drink initiation on days without intent to drink. Results showed that participants were significantly more likely to report drinking initiation when they experienced craving at the prior prompt that was greater than that day's typical craving. Drink initiation was also related to concurrent increases in craving. When participants reported their first drink on an unplanned drinking day, they were significantly more likely to report being in a bar or with other people; however, this effect was not explained by being with others or in a bar at the previous prompt (prior to drink initiation). Day-and person-level experiences of urgency were related to lower odds of drink initiation. Reporting greater than usual poor premeditation in a day was also significantly related to drink initiation. Discussion The primary aim of the present study was to identify proximal predictors of unplanned drinking in the daily life of those with emotion dysregulation. Results indicate that certain social and environmental contexts and increases in impulsivity and craving were the primary predictors of drinking and the amount of alcohol consumed on unplanned drinking days. The contexts related to unplanned drinking behaviors in this study are consistent with contexts related to drinking in general (planned or unplanned). General drinking most often occurs in socially-normative 2 Supplemental analyses were conducted to predict drinking behavior on days when participants did report intention to drink that morning. Analytic plan, results, and discussion are included in supplementary materials. Generally, results showed some convergence in the daily-life factors associated with planned and unplanned drinking; however, planned and unplanned drinking do not show identical relationships with daily-life experiences and contexts. environments, such as being with other people or in a bar/restaurant , which are the same contexts associated with unplanned drinking here. Interestingly, these contexts primarily related to whether participants drank and not how much participants drank. Moreover, spending time in a bar or with other people did not significantly predict subsequent drink initiation on days without intention to drink (although these were related to concurrent drinking initiation). Participants tended to be in bars and with people when they initiated unplanned drinking but did not tend to be at bars or with people at the prompt prior, which suggests that the decision to enter these socially-normative drinking contexts (and possibly the decision to engage in unplanned drinking) may have occurred somewhere between these two prompts. The time between responses prior to drinking in this sample averaged 157 min, or roughly 2.5 h. Future studies interested in capturing the momentary circumstances surrounding the decision to engage in unplanned drinking may want to consider a sampling schedule with more frequent prompts and ask about intention to drink throughout the day. Additionally, these analyses highlight that time with other people tends to increase the likelihood of unplanned drinking; however, it is possible that certain ""types"" of individuals may have differential effects on drinking behavior. For example, spending time with ""drinking buddies"" or individuals with whom a person frequently drinks may increase the likelihood of drinking while spending time with other groups of individuals (e.g., boss, children) may decrease the likelihood of drinking. The differential impact of different social influences on unplanned drinking would be a meaningful avenue for research. Subjective experience of impulsivity in daily life predicted whether individuals engaged in unplanned drinking and how much they drank in that unplanned episode; however, the relationship between impulsive facets and drinking varied across drinking outcomes. Participants who experienced relatively more negative urgency (emotion-based impulsivity) on that day and over the course of the EMA period were less likely to engage in unplanned drinking. Conversely, individuals who experienced greater urgency over the study period were more likely to drink more when they did drink. Previous cross-sectional studies have consistently shown that urgency is a significant predictor of both alcohol use patterns  and alcohol-related problems . Our findings suggest that individuals who experience greater urgency in their day-to-day lives are not necessarily more likely to engage in unplanned drinking but they are more likely to drink more heavily when they do. As such, they may be more susceptible to the greater problems and consequences associated with heavy unplanned drinking (e.g., . This interpretation is consistent with some research on the Model of Unplanned Drinking Behavior (MUDB; , which has shown cross-sectional associations between urgency and alcohol-related consequences via unplanned drinking. Interestingly though, our supplementary analyses did not find urgency associated with engagement in planned drinking, in contrast to previous studies , and actually urgency predicted consuming less alcohol on planned drinking days (See Supplementary Materials). This pattern of findings implies that the relationship between urgency and alcohol problems demonstrated in the cross-sectional literature may be driven by the increased problems and consequences for heavy unplanned drinking. As this is one of the first projects investigating impulsive states, traits, and unplanned drinking, this hypothesis should be tested in future studies and should be considered only a tentative finding until corroborated by additional studies. Individuals experiencing poorer premeditation on a given day without intent to drink were more likely to subsequently report drink initiation. Considering that premeditation is required to plan later behaviors and activities, this finding is perhaps not surprising. Previous research has also found that poor premeditation is related to drinking behaviors in general and risky drinking cross-sectionally  and in daily life . Recent evidence shows positive intervention effects on individual planning deficits ; therefore, improving premeditation skills may be an avenue for intervention among those experiencing negative consequences of unplanned drinking. Experiencing greater sensation seeking over the study period showed a negative association with amount of alcohol consumed on unplanned drinking days. Sensation seeking has shown inconsistent links with alcohol use in the cross-sectional and trait-based literature, with one review showing that the relationship may be better explained by covariate and/or moderating effects . The studies to date on momentary or state sensation seeking and alcohol use did not find a significant link between the two (e.g., ; however, the influence of state sensation seeking on alcohol use behavior is a relatively under-studied area and could be a fruitful area for future investigation, particularly as it pertains to unplanned alcohol use. Craving also related to drinking alcohol on days without intention to drink, but was not related to amount consumed. These results suggest that craving for alcohol increases the odds of alcohol consumption at the subsequent prompt and that experiencing increased craving in general also increased the likelihood of unplanned drinking. Importantly, these day-level and lagged craving effects are independent of actual alcohol consumption as craving ratings were only included prior to drinking initiation. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that alcohol craving predicts consumption ; however, this study is the first to show this relationship for unplanned drinking. It is notable that craving predicted unplanned drinking above and beyond other contextual factors in these models. Taken collectively, these findings offer several possible points of intervention. One possibility is modification of social and environmental contexts; individuals attempting to reduce unplanned drinking should minimize the time they spend in bars and restaurants and/or with other people on days they do not plan to drink. Future work to identify specific groups or types of individuals who might be particularly salient risk factors for unplanned drinking (e.g., drinking buddies) would aid in the implementation of these types of interventions. Second, individuals at high risk or in treatment for drinking problems should be screened for pre-drinking craving, as intervention on unplanned drinking may be targeted to those who experience higher levels of craving. Lastly, cognitive-behavioral intervention targeting planning deficits may also be useful in reducing engagement in unplanned drinking. These results should be interpreted with several limitations in mind. First, while our sample size is adequate for the within-person effects of interest here, these findings should be replicated in larger and more diverse samples. This sample was primarily female (81%) and white (91%). While gender was adjusted for in our analyses, future investigations should investigate these findings in more heterogeneous samples. Second, EMA assessments of impulsivity facets, craving, contexts, and amount of alcohol consumed were limited to single-item questions. Lastly, this sample was recruited for moderate/regular alcohol use, and was selected for emotion dysregulation diagnoses (i.e., current mood, anxiety, or borderline personality disorder), which are relatively common but may limit the generalizability of these findings to non-clinical samples and/or to heavier drinking samples. It is possible that including moderate/regular alcohol users inherently limited the range of drinking related variables including unplanned drinking engagement, quantity consumed, and craving. Future work should investigate predictors of unplanned drinking among heavier drinkers or individuals already experiencing alcohol-related impairments.

25,25,Quality versus quantity: Determining real-world social functioning deficits in schizophrenia,"Social dysfunction is a hallmark of schizophrenia that is associated with emotional disturbances. Researchers have employed ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to measure social and emotional functioning in people with schizophrenia. Yet, few studies have evaluated quality of real-world social interactions, and it is unclear how interactions impact emotional experiences in this population. Using novel EMA that passively collects audio data, we examined daily social behavior and emotion in schizophrenia (n = 38) and control (n = 36) groups. Contrary to hypotheses, both groups interacted with others at the same rate and exhibited similar levels of positive emotion. However, as expected, the schizophrenia group exhibited significantly less high-quality interactions and reported more negative emotion than controls. Social versus non-social context did not influence experienced emotion in either group. This is the first real-world study to passively assess quality of social interactions in schizophrenia. Although those with schizophrenia did not differ in their number of interactions, they were less likely to engage in substantive, personal conversations. Because high-quality interactions are linked with better social outcomes, this finding has important potential treatment implications. Future research should investigate quality of interactions across different types of social activities to gain a more nuanced understanding of social dysfunction in schizophrenia.","[""Schizophrenia"", ""Social functioning"", ""Emotion"", ""Ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113980,"Introduction Social dysfunction is a core and disabling feature of schizophrenia . Given its burden, it is vital to accurately identify and measure how people with schizophrenia exhibit social dysfunction in their daily lives. Although multiple definitions of social functioning exist, participation in social interactions and maintenance of interpersonal relationships are consistently referenced as fundamental aspects of this construct . Consequently, two commonly assessed elements of social functioning are frequency of social interactions and quality of interpersonal relationships. Frequency of social interactions is often used as a quantitative measure of social functioning, and involves conversations, activities, and time spent with other people. Compared to healthy people, people with schizophrenia spend less time interacting with others . Measuring quality of social relationships offers a more nuanced understanding of social functioning. In this regard, people with schizophrenia display less engagement or involvement during simulated social interactions and report having fewer intimate relationships than healthy people . Although clinical interviews and laboratory tasks have long been used to assess social functioning in schizophrenia, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has been frequently implemented in recent years . The immediacy of EMA protects against retrospective bias and the real-world context in which subjects are assessed increases external validity . EMA has widely been used to measure the first element of social functioning, frequency of social interactions ). Yet, less work has used EMA to measure the second element, quality of social relationships. Researchers posit that aspects of one's interactions with others shape the development of interpersonal relationships . Thus, measuring interaction quality using EMA may allow researchers to better gage this element of social functioning. Existing EMA studies have estimated quality of interactions by investigating who the subject is interacting with , the subject's performance appraisals of the interaction , and contextual factors of social activities (i.e., structured versus unstructured; . Although these represent qualitative features of interactions, more definitive measures to identify high-quality versus low-quality interactions are needed. One potential proxy for quality may be found in the content of conversations. People engage in various levels of conversation throughout their day (e.g., small talk, personal disclosures). Research suggests deeper-level conversations lead to greater happiness and well-being , and this may be due to their ability to foster closer social connections . Thus, content of conversations is not only an important qualitative aspect of social interactions, but may also strongly influence quality of relationships, the second major element of social functioning. In this way, assessing content of daily conversations as a measure of interaction quality may offer a nuanced understanding of social deficits in schizophrenia. EMA research has also shown links between social and emotional functioning in those with schizophrenia . Relative to healthy controls, people with schizophrenia exhibit reduced positive and increased negative emotion . Moreover, laboratory studies of people with schizophrenia show that positive emotion is correlated with more adaptive social functioning  and negative emotion is associated with worse social functioning, even after accounting for cognitive ability and severity of psychotic symptoms . Thus, EMA research has investigated emotional experiences within social interactions to better understand impairment in schizophrenia. In line with previous literature,  found that people with schizophrenia generally report more negative and less positive emotions compared with healthy controls. However, they reported similar emotional responses when in the company of other people; that is, both people with schizophrenia and controls exhibited increased positive feelings with others. So, it seems people with schizophrenia experience similar emotionality as controls when in social situations. Yet, we know that the social lives of those with schizophrenia drastically differ from the general population; people with schizophrenia spend significantly more time alone . Thus, differences in positive and negative emotion between those with schizophrenia and healthy controls may be exacerbated by differences in the number of social interactions they participate in daily. It is possible that, when in similar social contexts, differences in emotion between those with and without schizophrenia may be less pronounced. In this way, context (i.e., if the person is in a social interaction) may moderate the relationship between clinical status (schizophrenia versus control) and emotion. The current project aimed to elucidate the relationship between social functioning and emotion in schizophrenia using two forms of EMA: an active, self-report assessment of momentary emotion and a passive assessment of social interactions using audio recording. This passive method not only lets us objectively measure frequency of daily social interactions, but it also allows for a real-world assessment of the quality of those interactions based on the content of conversation. Data was collected from people with schizophrenia and healthy controls to test two primary hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that clinical status (schizophrenia versus control) would significantly predict social functioning and emotion. Consistent with previous research on social and emotional functioning , we anticipated that those with schizophrenia would exhibit worse social functioning, more negative emotions, and less positive emotions compared to controls. Second, we hypothesized that the relationship between clinical status and emotions would be moderated by context (social versus non-social). This is based on findings that frequency of social interactions has been associated with the experience of positive emotions in the general population , and people with schizophrenia show similar emotional responses in social situations as controls . This study uniquely contributes to the literature by using passive EMA to measure both quantity and quality of social interactions and is one of the first studies to directly test whether emotional differences found in schizophrenia depend on context (social versus non-social). Methods Participants and design Participants in the schizophrenia group (n = 38) were recruited from community mental health centers in Indianapolis, IN and had a primary diagnosis of a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder according to the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.; . Other inclusion criteria included: a) age 18-60; b) English fluency; c) no change in medication or outpatient status in the past month; d) ability to give informed consent; e) no active substance dependence; f) no documented intellectual disability; and g) no history of a neurological illness or head injury that resulted in loss of consciousness greater than five minutes. Participants in the control group (n = 36) were recruited via flyers, local healthcare centers, and a volunteer registry. Criteria mirrored the schizophrenia-spectrum group except those who: a) met current criteria for a psychiatric disorder or b) had a history of psychotic symptoms were excluded. Participants who did not do both active and passive EMA protocols were excluded from the current analyses. Measures The electronically activated recorder (EAR; mehl, 2007) The EAR is an application for smartphone devices to collect audio recordings of real-world social interactions. Previous studies have demonstrated its promise for capturing accurate behavioral and clinical information in everyday settings . In this study, participants wore the EAR device for two days. This time frame was chosen based on recommendations from the co-creator of the EAR  and findings that two days shows good temporal stability in healthy individuals and convergence with four-week time frames . The EAR was programed to record for 5 min every 90 min from 6:00 a.m. to midnight yielding two hours of audio data from each participant. This sampling method allowed us to collect behavioral data from different periods of the day with intervals long enough to capture situational context. Safeguards were put in place to protect confidentiality: a) subjects could remove the EAR any time they did not wish to be recorded; b) subjects could hear and delete recordings they did not wish to share with the research team; and c) the EAR device included a sign alerting others that it could be recording (i.e., ""This device is being used for research purposes. It records nearby surroundings at various intervals and may record your voice""). As in previous studies, less than 1% of files were deleted by participants . Additional audio files were excluded from analyses if subjects were sleeping, if there was an audio problem (e.g., inaudible), or if the subject was not wearing the EAR (see Table ). Objective ratings of social behaviors were coded from audio recordings. Specifically, frequency of social interactions and quality of those interactions were coded using a standardized coding system, the Social Environment Coding of Sound Inventory (SECSI; . Social interactions were calculated as frequency of recordings where subjects speak with another person during the five-minute interval (0=no interaction; 1=interaction). As such, one interaction was the maximum coded for a single 5-minute EAR recording. Quality of interactions was determined based on the content of conversations. High-quality interactions involved participating in personal, substantive conversation (i.e., subject's disclosure of thoughts/opinions or personal/emotional disclosures); Low-quality interactions involved no conversation, practical talk (i.e., ""I will pick Sally up at 5:00 PM""), or small talk (i.e., ""How's the weather?""). Quality of interactions was a dichotomous variable (0=low-quality interaction; 1= high quality interaction). The entire recording received a ""1 ′′ if participants achieved a high-quality interaction at any point during the 5-minute interval. Five trained raters completed the coding. Inter-rater reliability was initially established using a subset (10%) of randomly selected files; a high degree of reliability (ICC >0.9) was found for both codes. Daily social journal Social journals are paper assessments where subjects report on their activities throughout the day. Subjects recorded one journal entry each hour over the two days they wore the EAR. At each interval, subjects recorded what they were doing and rated their level of positive and negative emotions during the activity. Emotion ratings were made on seven-point Likert scale (0=No positive/negative feeling, 6=Extreme positive/negative feeling) with higher scores indicating higher levels of positive/negative emotions. Similar forms of EMA using diary methods have been successfully implemented for both clinical and healthy populations (e.g., . To promote convenience and subject compliance, social journals were small, paper packets that could be folded and carried in a pocket or purse. Each entry was brief, taking approximately 1-2 min to complete. This social journal has been used to detect differences in emotion between people with schizotypy and healthy controls . Procedure This research was carried out in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board at Indiana University. Subjects were offered two-way transportation to the laboratory and provided written informed consent prior to study participation. In the lab, subjects completed semi-structured interviews to gather demographic and clinical information, including symptom severity (assessed via the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scales [PANSS; ). Next, subjects were given EMA materials and training on how to use them. Specifically, subjects received a mobile device with the EAR application and were instructed to wear it in a protective carrying case attached to the outside of their clothing (e.g., belt, shirt pocket, pants pocket) over the next two days. Subjects were unaware of when recordings would occur but were told the device would record about five percent of the two-day period. Subjects were also provided a blank social journal packet, instructed to keep the packet with them, and complete one journal entry during each waking hour over the two-day period. Subjects were paid up to $50 for completing EMA procedures. Analyses Analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 24. Chi-square tests for independence and independent samples t-tests were used to compare groups on demographic and EAR data. We also calculated symptom severity in the schizophrenia group using a 5-factor structure of the PANSS: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, cognitive symptoms, depressive symptoms, and hostility symptoms . Multilevel modeling was used to test hypotheses due to its ability to model nested data: assessment time points (Level 1) were nested within individuals (Level 2). First, two multilevel binary logistic regression models were conducted to assess whether group predicted EAR measures of social functioning. In these analyses, we included the random intercept and group status (schizophrenia/control) as the level-2 predictor, and outcome variables were EAR social interaction code (Model 1) and EAR quality of interaction code (Model 2). Next, two multi-level regression analyses were used to test if clinical status (schizophrenia/ control) predicted reported emotion from the social journal. Again, we included the random intercept and group status as the level-2 predictor; outcome variables were social journal positive emotion (Model 1) and negative emotion (Model 2). Finally, two multilevel models were created to determine if the group effect on social journal positive emotion (Model 1) and negative emotion (Model 2) varied by context (social versus non-social) as determined by the EAR social interaction code. In each of these models, we included the random intercept, group status as a level-2 predictor, context as a level-1 predictor with random slope, as well as the interaction between level 1 and 2 predictors. Results Descriptive analyses Table  outlines demographic and audio data between groups as well as clinical information of the schizophrenia group. Groups did not differ on age, sex, race, nor ethnicity. The control group was significantly more likely to be employed and married compared to the schizophrenia group. Overall, participants completed 98.08% of all social journal entries (schizophrenia group: 96.82%, control group: 99.43%). The only EAR data point that differed between groups was in the number of audio problems, such that the schizophrenia group experienced more audio problems than the control group. The schizophrenia group exhibited mild symptom severity on all PANSS scales. Secondary analyses were conducted exploring the effects of symptom severity on EAR and social journal measures in the schizophrenia group. Specifically, we examined how daily functioning measures of those considered in remission of illness (as defined by  compared to those not in remission. We also tested associations between symptom domains and EMA measures. See Supplementary Tables  for details of these analyses. Group as a predictor of social and emotional functioning in daily life Our hypotheses that group status (schizophrenia/control) would predict social functioning indices were partially supported. Group did not significantly predict EAR frequency of social interactions, OR=0.93, 95% CI=[0.55, 1.57], p = 0.777, but did significantly predict EAR quality of interactions, OR=0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI)=[0.28, 0.77], p = 0.003. Thus, for those in the schizophrenia group, the odds of engaging in a high-quality interaction at a given time point was 53% lower than for controls (see Table ). Results partially supported hypotheses that group status (schizophrenia/control) would predict reported emotions from the social journal. The effect of group status on social journal positive emotion only approached significance, B=− 0.50, SE=0.27, p = 0.074; however, group status did significantly predict social journal negative emotion, B = 0.65, SE=0.24, p = 0.008. The schizophrenia group reported more negative emotions than controls (see Table ). Moderation of context on the relationship between group and emotion The group by context interaction was not significant for social journal positive emotion, B=− 0.14, SE=0.17, p = 0.390, nor negative emotion, B=− 0.01, SE=0.15, p = 0.973. As in previous models, the main effect of group was significant for social journal negative emotion, but not positive emotion. The main effect of context was not significant for either social journal negative emotion, B = 0.003, SE=0.07, p = 0.970, or positive emotion, B = 0.02, SE=0.08, p = 0.809. The hypotheses that group by context interactions would occur for positive and negative emotion were not supported (see Fig. ). Discussion This study sought to identify real-world social and emotional deficits in schizophrenia by implementing active and passive EMA. Three interesting findings emerged. First, although schizophrenia and control groups interacted with others at the same rate, those in the schizophrenia group exhibited significantly fewer high-quality interactions. This suggests social dysfunction in schizophrenia may not result from a lack of interaction, but rather deficits in deeper-level exchanges. Next, compared to controls, people with schizophrenia exhibited similar levels of positive emotion, but more negative emotion, in their daily lives. Lastly, context did not moderate the relationship between clinical status and reported emotion; levels of positive and negative emotion were similar in both groups across social and non-social contexts. Contrary to hypotheses, clinical status (schizophrenia versus control) did not predict frequency of social interactions. Previous EMA studies suggest those with schizophrenia spend significantly more time alone . One explanation for the discrepancy in our findings could be the novel way in which we assessed frequency of social interactions. First, the EAR used a shorter sampling duration (i.e., two days) compared to most other studies who survey participants over 6-7 days . Second, whereas the EAR passively assessed social interactions, previous forms of EMA have used self-report and operationalized social interactions differently. For example, other studies asked participants to estimate how many times they communicated with someone since the last survey , document whether they are ""currently interacting"" , or document if they are ""currently alone"" . In contrast, we used EAR audio recordings and operationalized social interactions as the presence of interactive speech with another person. Both existing EMA and EAR approaches have strengths and weaknesses. Asking participants to estimate number of interactions since a previous survey has the benefit of assessing social behavior between EMA intervals; however, it is vulnerable to retrospective error and leaves room for interpretation. Participants may not recall every interaction nor consider brief exchanges as interactions. Moreover, when reporting on current social behavior, participants may not report interactions that occurred a few minutes prior to being asked (but within the 5-minute interval of an EAR recording). Finally, asking if a subject is currently alone measures whether subjects are around others, but not necessarily interacting. By providing a sample of audio data to be coded, the EAR objectively assesses frequency of social interactions as defined by conversations. However, it may miss social behavior in which there is no speaking or social behavior that occurred between recorded intervals. In this way, the discrepancy between our results and previous studies may be explained by differences in EMA methods. In line with our expectations, clinical status predicted quality of interactions. Whereas control participants exhibited high-quality interactions in nearly a third of their files, those with schizophrenia demonstrated high-quality interactions in less than one-fifth of files. This suggests that, although those in the schizophrenia group interact as much as control participants, they spend less time engaging in substantive, more personal conversations (e.g., sharing thoughts, opinions, or emotional information). Because this is the first EMA study to examine such qualitative aspects of social interactions, these results are innovative and crucial for understanding social deficits in those with schizophrenia. Deficits in high-quality interactions have important clinical implications for those with schizophrenia. It has been theorized that deeper conversations, rather than mere small talk, lead to stronger social connections and, therefore, greater well-being . Furthermore,  found that quality of social relationships predicted individuals' health above and beyond quantity of interactions. When compared to healthy people, those with schizophrenia have fewer friends, narrower social networks, and diminished social support . Thus, the lack of high-quality interactions found in the schizophrenia group may suggest that diminished engagement in deeper-level conversations is driving these differences in quality and quantity of relationships. Although cognitive impairment and negative symptom severity have been theorized to drive social dysfunction in schizophrenia , these symptom domains were not associated with daily social functioning in our sample (see Supplementary Table ), suggesting deficient social engagement is pervasive in this disorder. People with schizophrenia desire social affiliation  and identify improving social functioning as a primary therapeutic goal . Distinguishing between quantity and quality of social interactions in the treatment of schizophrenia could have important implications for social skills training programs. Results Notes. Frequency = Percent of audio records; SD = Standard deviation; Positive and negative emotion scores ranged from 1 to 7. suggest that the development of treatment approaches that specifically foster deep social connections, rather than surface-level interactions, would be beneficial to increase social affiliation and quality of relationships. Our hypothesis that group (schizophrenia/control) would predict reported emotion was only partly supported. Compared to controls, people with schizophrenia reported similar levels of positive emotion but more negative emotion. A meta-analysis of EMA studies suggests that, when reporting their day-to-day experiences, those with schizophrenia report more negative and less positive emotion than controls ; thus, our results only partially align with this literature. Our method of measurement may, again, explain this discrepancy. The social journal uses a singular item to rate participants' level of 'positive feeling.' Other EMA studies have calculated positive emotion by averaging ratings of various mood states (e.g., 'cheerful,' 'relaxed,' 'satisfied; . This more detailed assessment requires less participant interpretation and may more accurately capture emotional experiences. Alternatively, similar levels of positive emotion in our groups could be due to the generally mild symptom severity of our schizophrenia sample, as emotional dysfunction is associated with cognitive impairment and negative symptoms . Contrary to our hypothesis, context did not moderate the relationship between clinical status and emotion. For positive emotion, these results are understandable as groups did not differ in this domain. Moreover, researchers have previously found that those with schizophrenia do not differ from controls in positive emotion during social experiences . For negative emotion, group differences were found, but participants' context when reporting emotion did not influence this difference. Although previous research has examined emotional experiences of people with schizophrenia during social activities, this was one of the first studies to examine the moderating effect of context on group differences in emotion. Yet,  found people with schizophrenia and healthy controls similarly reported significantly less positive and more negative emotion when alone compared to with others. Our results do not align with this study, as social context did not influence emotion in either group. As mentioned above, our methods of measuring social versus non-social context and emotion differed from this study; these differences may explain some variability in our results. More research is needed to clarify if and how social interactions impact emotional experiences in those with and without schizophrenia. Strengths of this project include the use of both active and passive EMA to provide a deeper understanding of social and emotional deficits in people with schizophrenia. However, this study also has limitations. First, our relatively small sample makes power to detect true relationships a concern. Moreover, our schizophrenia sample exhibited mild symptom severity and may not reflect social functioning of those with more severe symptomology. Thus, these results should be replicated in larger samples. Second, our use of passive EMA required us to simplify the definition of social functioning (i.e., frequency of interactions and high-quality conversations) since we could only code for concrete social behaviors captured via audio recording. There are latent factors (e.g., social cognition, social problem solving, subject's performance appraisals) and behaviors that cannot be measured via audio (e.g., facial expression) to also consider in determining deficits in social functioning in schizophrenia. Participants may also act differently in social situations because they are wearing a recording device. Although such reactivity is concerning, previous studies suggests that participants habituate to the EAR within a few hours . We also alleviated this issue by 1) ensuring participants were unaware of when they were recorded; and 2) allowing participants to listen to and delete sensitive recordings before our team accesses them. Lastly, our measure of emotion using the social journal heavily relies on subject compliance; some may forget to complete journal entries in-the-moment, making this assessment not a true EMA. We tried to mitigate this concern by explaining the importance of in-the-moment ratings to participants, making the social journal packet small and convenient to carry, and making journal entries brief to not over-burden participants. Results of this project yield important implications for future work. As mentioned, this is the first study to examine social functioning in schizophrenia using passive audio data. Additionally, we investigated differences in both quantity and quality of social interactions. Future studies are needed to further implement these methods. For example,  examined emotional experiences during structured versus unstructured social activities. Results found that people with schizophrenia matched controls on frequency of unstructured social activities, but patients spent significantly less time in structured social activities. Moreover, patients reported the same emotional experiences in both social and non-social contexts. Our research design using the EAR could extend  findings by determining how quality of interactions maps onto both structured and unstructured activity in the lives of those with schizophrenia. Quality of interactions, rather than frequency of social activities, may be more related to differences in emotional experiences. Relatedly, the EAR may also be applied to research examining differences in who people interact with.  examined how much time people spend with familiar versus unfamiliar people and found the schizophrenia group spent more time with family or friends compared to coworkers and strangers. Participant's appraisals of specific interaction partners (e.g., extent to which they like the other person) may also affect their willingness to engage in high-quality of interactions. Thus, future work may examine quality of interactions as a function who the person is interacting with and if that differently affects those with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Overall, incorporating the EAR into future studies will help us better understand the real-life social experiences of those with schizophrenia. Examining social functioning at this more granular level is a promising avenue for EMA research in schizophrenia.  Declaration of Competing Interest None. "
26,26,"Racial Discrimination, Sedentary Time, and Physical Activity in African Americans: Quantitative Study Combining Ecological Momentary Assessment and Accelerometers","Background: A growing number of studies indicate that exposure to social stress, such as perceived racial discrimination, may contribute to poor health, health behaviors, and health disparities. Increased physical activity (PA) may buffer the impact of social stress resulting from racial discrimination. However, to date, data on the relationship between racial discrimination and PA have been mixed. Part of the reason is that the effect of perceived racial discrimination on PA has primarily been examined in cross-sectional studies that captured retrospective measures of perceived racial discrimination associated with individuals' current PA outcomes. The association between real-time perceived racial discrimination and PA among African Americans remains unclear.Objective: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship among demographic, anthropometric and clinical, and psychological factors with lifetime racial discrimination and examine the within-and between-person associations between daily real-time racial discrimination and PA outcomes (total energy expenditure, sedentary time, and moderate-to-vigorous PA patterns) measured by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and accelerometers in healthy African Americans.Methods: This pilot study used an intensive, observational, case-crossover design of African Americans (n=12) recruited from the community. After participants completed baseline surveys, they were asked to wear an accelerometer for 7 days to measure their PA levels. EMA was sent to participants 5 times per day for 7 days to assess daily real-time racial discrimination. Multilevel models were used to examine the within-and between-person associations of daily racial discrimination on PA.Results: More EMA-reported daily racial discrimination was associated with younger age (r=0.75; P=.02). Daily EMA-reported microaggression was associated with depressive symptoms (r=0.66; P=.05), past race-related events (r=0.82; P=.004), and lifetime discrimination (r=0.78; P=.01). In the within-person analyses, the day-level association of racial discrimination and sedentary time was significant (Î²=.30, SE 0.14; P=.03), indicating that on occasions when participants reported more racial discrimination than usual, more sedentary time was observed. Between-person associations of racial discrimination  SE 0.28; P=.29)   or microaggression  SE 0.36; P=.34)  with total energy expenditure were suggestive but inconclusive.Conclusions: Concurrent use of EMA and accelerometers is a feasible method to examine the relationship between racial discrimination and PA in real time. Examining daily processes at the within-person level has the potential to elucidate the mechanisms of which racial discrimination may have on health and health behaviors and to guide the development of personalized interventions for increasing PA in racial ethnic minorities. Future studies with a precision health approach, incorporating withinand between-person associations, are warranted to further elucidate the effects of racial discrimination and PA.","[""racial discrimination"", ""physical activity"", ""ecological momentary assessment"", ""African American"", ""pilot study"", ""mobile phone""]",10.2196/25687,"Introduction Background African Americans continue to experience disproportionately higher rates of cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders than their White counterparts . Although health disparities have been attributed to multiple factors, African Americans have been more likely than other racial and ethnic groups to report perceived racial discrimination (eg, 71.3% vs 24% in non-Hispanic Whites) . In extensive research, exposure to racial discrimination events or perceived racial discrimination contributes to poor health, health behaviors, and health disparities . Social stress derived from systems of inequality, such as racial discrimination, may provoke severe psychological and physiological responses and has been associated with unhealthy behaviors . Studies have shown that perceived racial discrimination is linked to the consumption of fatty foods, smoking, and alcohol intake . Increased physical activity (PA) may buffer the impact of social stress resulting from racial discrimination . To date, studies on the relationship between racial discrimination and PA have shown inconclusive findings. For example, in a multiethnic study of PA, racial discrimination was not associated with PA as measured by pedometers when examined among the full sample or separately by race and ethnicity . An unexpected finding was reported in the Jackson Heart Study cohort , with higher daily and lifetime racial discrimination associated with more PA in women based on their self-reported PA. In addition, although not in the context of racial discrimination, some studies of psychological stress in other populations have linked perceived stress with less PA . In recent studies that examined both between-and within-person effects of daily stress on PA, there was significant between-person variability in the relationship between PA and stress . For example, the relationship may be bidirectional for some people; for others, it may be unidirectional or have no association, suggesting that examining the within-person effect of stress on PA may address the limitations of between-person analysis that predominate in traditional research . To date, data on the relationship between racial discrimination and PA are sparse and inconsistent. Part of the reason is that the literature to date on the effect of perceived racial discrimination on PA comprises mostly cross-sectional studies that capture retrospective measures of lifetime discrimination associated with individuals' current health outcomes. Such data may be subject to recall and rumination biases. Furthermore, racial microaggressions-the brief and commonplace daily verbal or nonverbal denigrating messages directed toward racial and ethnic minorities that carry the offending party's implicit or unconscious bias-have been shown to disempower racial minorities and may negatively impact health outcomes . However, this subtle form of racial discrimination may be difficult to capture by retrospective measures and has been understudied in research on perceived racial discrimination and health. In this study, we prospectively examined racial microaggression (hereinafter microaggression) as a subtle form of racial discrimination as well as lifetime racial discrimination. Examining perceived racial discrimination or microaggression at a single point in time-not incorporating the perspective that this experience fluctuates but combining with cumulative past experience of racial discrimination-may have limitations in examining the differences in behavioral responses across settings and time. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a real-time, self-report data-capturing method in which people report behavior in real time at multiple time points in their natural environment. It may reduce recall biases and enhance ecological validity by collecting self-report data that are more proximal to the time and place (ie, real world) in which stressful events and behaviors occur . Recently, a growing number of studies that explore discrimination and health outcomes using EMA have been published; for example, the relationships between real-time discriminatory experiences and health behaviors have been examined in various sexual and gender ethnic minority groups . The EMA method provides the opportunity to examine how fluctuations in daily perceived racial discrimination or microaggressions are associated with PA among African Americans at the within-person level. In addition, the use of accelerometers can minimize the weakness of self-report measures of PA. Objectives Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study is  to describe the relationship among demographic (age, sex, income, and education), anthropometric and clinical factors (BMI, blood pressure, and body composition), and psychological factors (depression) with lifetime racial discrimination and (2) to examine the effects of real-time racial discrimination on total energy expenditure, sedentary time, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) patterns of objectively measured PA using accelerometers and a real-time data capture strategy, that is, EMA in healthy African American adults at both the group (eg, between-person level) and individual (eg, within-person level approach or N-of-1) level. Methods Study Design This study is a substudy of an intensive, observational, case-crossover design to examine the effects of perceived racial discrimination on physiological (ie, stress biomarkers) and behavioral responses in African Americans. Details of the overall study protocols have been published elsewhere . In a case-crossover design, each participant serves as their own control to assess the within-person effects on repeatedly measured PA outcomes . Within-person analysis of effects on PA occurred at the 2-hour interval level (using EMA at the end of the interval querying participants about racial discrimination over the duration of the interval) and day level (using average scores of EMA response across the day). Participants and Recruitment Building on a relationship developed over the past 10 years, the research team recruited participants from greater New Haven communities in Connecticut via flyers and word-of-mouth communication within African American communities. Before implementing the study, we held meetings with community stakeholders to discuss an effective recruitment plan and the details of the pilot study protocols. Potential participants were called in and were screened by phone and scheduled for a baseline orientation visit. The inclusion criteria were (1) self-reported African American or Black, (2) aged between 30 and 55 years, (3) currently employed, (4) ownership of a smartphone, (5) able to respond to smartphone-based random survey prompts (ie, EMA) at least 3 times per day, and (6) English speaking. We excluded participants who were pregnant or who had serious acute or terminal medical conditions that would preclude PA. The sample size (n=12) was largely based on guidelines for pilot studies that suggest 10 to 40 participants per cell . Even assuming moderate attrition of 20% (2/12), we would have 10 subjects, which is still within the guidelines for pilot studies . We also estimated the minimum detectable effect sizes of other outcomes (ie, stress biomarkers-data not shown; ). Our observations would be able to detect medium effect sizes of 0.53-0.60 on primary outcomes (stress biomarkers) repeatedly measured within the individual with 80% power at a 5% significance level, based on a previous study using stress biomarkers . Baseline Measures Baseline surveys included sociodemographic characteristics; current smoking status (yes or no); and alcohol consumption by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test , which includes frequency of drinking and amount of alcohol consumption. We also used validated self-report measures collected at baseline that are mentioned below. Perceived racial discrimination was measured at baseline using 2 scales. The Major Life Discrimination (MLD) scale is a 9-item self-report measure of past exposures to lifetime discrimination in diverse domains. Respondents indicated whether they had ever experienced each listed major discrimination event (eg, denied a bank loan, unfairly fired, getting a job, at work, and stopped by police; Cronbach α≥.88) . The MLD score represented the sum of each yes or no item (range 0-9). Higher scores indicate more lifetime discriminatory experiences. The Race-Related Events Scale (RES) has 22 items to assess exposure to stressful and potentially traumatizing experiences of race-related stresses in adults. Respondents indicated whether they had ever experienced each event (yes or no), and the items were summed for a total RES score ranging from 0 to 22 (Cronbach α=.78-.88) . Higher scores indicate more experiences of race-related stressful events. The Black Racial Identity-Centrality subscale (Cronbach α>.77) is an 8-item, 7-point Likert scale (ranging from strongly disagree=1 to strongly agree=7). The centrality dimension of racial identity refers to the extent to which individuals normally define themselves with regard to race. It is a measure of whether race is a core part of an individual's self-concept . After reverse-scoring 3 items, the overall score was calculated by averaging all items, with higher scores indicating stronger racial identity. For subjective social status, participants were asked to place an ""X"" on the rung that best represented where they thought they stood on the ladder, with 10 rungs described as follows: at the top of the ladder are people who are the best off, those who have the most money, those who have the most education, and those who have the best jobs, and at the bottom are people who are the worst off, those who have the least money, those who have the least education, and those who have the worst jobs or no job (test-retest reliability, ρ=0.62) . The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is a 4-point Likert scale that captures current depressive symptoms with 20 items on how respondents have felt or behaved during the past week by selecting 1 of the 4 options (0=rarely, 1=some of the time, 2=occasionally, and 3=most of the time). The items were summed to obtain a total score. Higher numbers indicate greater depressive symptoms (Cronbach α>.85) . A recent meta-analysis  showed that a cutoff point of 20 yields a more adequate trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, compared with the cutoff point of , which has been used to indicate probable clinical depression. EMA Measures Perceived racial discrimination was measured using the Experiences of Discrimination (EOD; Cronbach α>.88)  and Racial Microaggression Scale (RMAS; Cronbach α>.85)  adapted for EMA data collection. The EOD has subscales for worry, global, filed complaint, response to unfair treatment, day-to-day discrimination, and skin color . The RMAS has subscales for invisibility, criminality, low-achieving or undesirable culture, sexualization, foreigner or not belonging, and environmental invalidations . As the EOD and RMAS measure experiences of unfair treatment over the past month to year, of which response options are not relevant for real-time EMA assessment, response choices were revised for the EMA time frame using yes or no answers or Likert scale options. We also used a random subscale inclusion strategy so that only 60% of the items would be included in each EMA survey to reduce the subject burden and survey fatigue . When prompted, participants were asked to report whether they had experienced any unfair treatment from a list of 11 common daily racial discriminations since their last prompt or within the past 2-3 hours if they missed or did not complete their last prompt (eg, ""treated with less courtesy than other people because of your race or ethnicity,"" yes=1 or no=0) and also from a list of 32 microaggression experiences (eg, ""people mistake me for being a service worker simply because of my race or ethnicity,"" 1=strongly disagree to 7=strongly agree). Possible daily scores of the EOD range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more racial discriminatory experiences. Possible daily RMAS scores range from 15 to 105, with higher scores indicating more microaggression. Each survey (5 times per day) consisted of 8-15 different combinations of questions varying by time of day (sequentially from the first survey to the fifth survey throughout the day). PA Measures PA was measured using a triaxial hip accelerometer (ActiGraph GT9X), which samples movement at 30 Hz and aggregates data into 60-second epochs. The intensity cut points for PA were defined using validated thresholds for vertical axis accelerometry (sedentary<100 counts/min, moderate=2020 counts/min, and vigorous=5999 counts/min) . Energy expenditure was calculated using respective validated triaxial vector magnitude (VM) equations for >2453 VM counts per minute  and ≤2453 VM counts per minute . The nonwear periods were defined as ≥60 consecutive minutes of zero activity intensity counts, with allowance for 1-2 minutes of counts between 0 and 100. We considered a day valid if ≥10 hours of activity counts were collected  and a 2-hour interval valid if the full time was collected. Accelerometer data were downloaded into ActiLife software (ActiGraph) using the software's normal filters and scored to create the following variables: total wear time (min), daily wear time (hour/day), total daily energy expenditure, MVPA (min/day), and sedentary time (hour/day). For within-person analyses, these were normalized to the wear time (eg, percent time in MVPA). Procedures Institutional review board approval was obtained from Yale University, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. At the initial study visit, face-to-face baseline interviews were completed using validated questionnaires. Body weight and height were measured using a portable electronic scale (Omron HBF-514C body composition monitor and scale) and a stadiometer (Seca) following standard procedures. BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height squared (m 2 ). Percent body composition was measured using the same digital scale that measures foot-to-foot bioelectric impedance. This method has demonstrated significant correlations with the gold standard of body fat calculation (ie, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan) . After 5 minutes of rest, blood pressure was measured twice with an automated cuff (Omron HEM 780 IntelliSense automatic blood pressure monitor), with 1 minute between readings, and the average of the 2 readings was recorded. To tailor the EMA survey delivery time, we asked participants for their sleep, wake, or commuting schedules by phone before the baseline study visit. At the baseline visit, we loaded the mEMA app, which is compatible with both iOS and Android operating systems, into each participant's smartphone. The EMA survey prompted each participant at a random time within the 5 preprogrammed windows daily (ie, signal-contingent sampling) for 7 days (a total of 35 signals) to ensure adequate spacing throughout the day, except for nighttime and commuting time. Upon hearing the signal or vibration, the participants were instructed to complete a short electronic question sequence using their smartphone. Each EMA survey took approximately 3-4 minutes to answer. The EMA data collection system recorded the date and time it took each participant to respond to a random prompt survey and the date and time the survey expired. The survey expired after 40 minutes of nonresponse. After no entry was made, the EMA program became inaccessible until the next recording opportunity. Participants were instructed to wear an accelerometer on their right hip during waking hours for 7 consecutive days to obtain at least three weekdays and one weekend day to determine the daily variability . A paper diary was provided, and participants were instructed to fill out the diary on the time they took off (eg, shower) and wore their accelerometers. All participants received one-on-one in-person training in the EMA surveys and accelerometers. We also provided pictures and step-by-step written instructions on the use of EMA, accelerometers, a tiered payment schedule, and research staff contact information. In addition to the study questions, we sent reminders through EMA to wear their accelerometer daily for all 7 days. We also assessed the risks and symptoms of participants with a risk for depression (based on CES-D>16) and suggested primary care office visits or made referrals per study protocol. Data Management and Analysis EMA data were exported from the mEMA server to a comma-separated values file format. We entered the EMA and accelerometer data as well as the baseline surveys and anthropometric and clinical data into a database uploaded into SAS for analysis. We reviewed the data and corrected errors, missing data, outliers, and skewness and calculated the scale scores for the EMA responses. Descriptive analysis was used for demographic characteristics, anthropometric and clinical data, and the average values for EMA and PA data. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated at the individual level using the following variables: age, sex, BMI, CES-D, RES sum, MLD sum, annual income, education, blood pressure, body fat, racial identity, subjective social status, smoking and alcohol consumption, EMA survey data, and accelerometer data. EMA and PA data were scored for daily and individual (average in subject) levels. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to quantify the proportions of total variance of PA explained by within-and between-person variances. Multilevel models for predicting PA (percentage sedentary time and percentage MVPA) were developed to examine the associations with EMA survey data (racial discrimination and microaggression) at the 2-hour interval (within-person), daily (within-person), and individual (between-person) levels. The models included within-and between-person levels of racial discrimination (model 1) or microaggression (model 2) with covariates (eg, age, sex, and BMI). Compound symmetry was used as a within-person correlation structure. Standardized coefficients were obtained using standardized outcomes and covariates with 0 mean and 1 SD.  Results Overview The mean response rate for EMA surveys was 83% (29/35; SD 16%), and the mean number of EMA responses per day was 4.0 (SD 1.2) out of a possible maximum of 5 per day. A total of 83.3% (10/12) of participants met the inclusion requirements for valid accelerometer data (≥10 hours/day wear time) and wore the accelerometer on the hip 6 out of 7 days. The mean EMA-reported daily racial discrimination was 0.61 (SD 0.85) per day, with a range of 0-2.28 (possible range: 0 to 10 times/day). Three participants reported no daily racial discrimination over the 7-day period (ie, their 7-day mean racial discrimination was 0). For the EMA-reported daily microaggression, the mean score was 50.26 (SD 18.11), with a range of 19.14-76.71 (possible range: 15-105/day). Participant characteristics and descriptive statistics from the survey and anthropometric and clinical and accelerometer data are presented in Table . The mean age was 43.4 (SD 7.73) years. The majority worked full-time. Approximately 67% (8/12) had an annual income of less than US $60,000. The mean CES-D score was 21.08 (SD 8.36). The mean Black racial identity (centrality) was 5.21 (SD 1.46), indicating that most of our participants self-defined Black race as a core part of their self-concept. The mean subjective social status was 7.08, indicating that most rated their social status as high in the community. The mean BMI was 34.19 (SD 11.41) kg/cm 2 ; approximately 42% (5/12) of the participants were obese. The mean MVPA was 18.5 minutes/day, and the mean sedentary time was 8.6 hours/day. Paired data, including both EMA and valid accelerometer data, resulted in a sample size of 9.    Between-Persons Survey and EMA Analyses In the bivariate analysis, using baseline surveys and anthropometric and clinical data, depressive symptoms were associated with major lifetime discrimination (r=0.58; P=.04) and a higher frequency of major lifetime discrimination (r=0.67; P=.04). Visceral fat was associated with diastolic blood pressure (r=0.62; P=.04) and sedentary time (r=0.73; P=.04) but was not associated with major lifetime discrimination. Income level was not significantly associated with Black racial identity (centrality; r=−0.26; P=.41). Table  shows the bivariate correlations between the baseline sample characteristics and the average of the EMA-reported daily racial discrimination variables or PA variables. Greater EMA-reported daily racial discrimination was significantly associated with younger age (r=−0.75; P=.02). Black racial identity was not significantly associated with EMA-reported daily racial discrimination (r=0.21; P=.58) or microaggression (r=0.06; P=.88). Daily EMA-reported microaggression was associated with depressive symptoms (r=0.66; P=.05), past race-related events (r=0.82; P=.004), and major lifetime discrimination (r=0.78; P=.01). A higher total energy expenditure was significantly associated with less major lifetime discrimination (r=−0.92; P=.004). Less sedentary time was significantly associated with a stronger Black racial identity (r=−0.68; P=.04). More MVPA was significantly associated with lower levels of subjective social status (r=−0.75; P=.02).  Within-and Between-Person EMA Analyses Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to represent the proportion of the total variance of the PA outcomes explained by the between-person levels. They were 0.54, 0.26, and 0.66 for total energy expenditure, sedentary time, and MVPA, respectively. The within-person interval-level analysis found that during the 2-hour windows in which people reported more perceived racial discrimination, they had moderately greater sedentary time (β=.30, SE 0.21; P=.18) and slightly more MVPA (β=.04, SE 0.13; P=.77). Similarly, during the 2-hour windows in which they reported more perceived microaggression, they had less sedentary time (β=−.11, SE 0.16; P=.51) and less MVPA (β=−.34, SE 0.18; P=.10). However, none of these relationships during the 2-hour windows reached statistical significance. The within-person daily levels and between-person analyses are presented in Table . In the within-person daily-level analyses, the association of racial discrimination and sedentary time was significant (β=.30, SE 0.14; P=.03), indicating that during days when participants reported more perceived racial discrimination, they had moderately more sedentary time.  Discussion Principal Findings Perceived racial discrimination is a significant psychological stressor that is hypothesized to have negative mental and physical health consequences with potential interactions with unhealthy behaviors. The relationship between overall psychological stress level and PA using EMA and objective measures has been evaluated in the general population; however, in what we believe to be the first published study of its kind, we examined momentary-and daily-level perceived racial discrimination and PA levels using EMA and accelerometers in African Americans. We collected repeated real-time racial discrimination exposure data in the natural environment while simultaneously collecting objective measures of sedentary behaviors and PA among African Americans. We also demonstrated the utility and feasibility of EMA coupled with accelerometers in studying the relationship between daily racial discrimination and PA in African Americans. Conventional accelerometer protocols require only 4 valid days for a 7-day wear period to be considered valid . Approximately 83% (10/12) of our participants met the inclusion requirement for valid accelerometer data (≥10 hours/day wear time) and wore the accelerometer 6 out of 7 days, and they also showed high adherence to the EMA protocol. In the examination of within-person level data, on days when participants reported more perceived racial discrimination than usual (ie, higher than their personal mean), more sedentary time was observed in the accelerometer data. The between-person analysis did not duplicate this finding in our study. However, this is consistent with the findings of between-person analysis in a prior study examining the relationship between general psychological stress and sedentary behaviors in other populations: end-of-day general stress ratings were not associated with sedentary time in the between-person analysis (at the group level) . The influence of stress on sedentary behavior varies according to the source of stress within individuals . Heterogeneity in the effect of stress on the amount and pattern of sedentary behaviors has been documented; for example, argument-related stress was associated with increased sedentary time, whereas work-related stress was associated with decreased sedentary time . Similarly, in a study of sexual and gender minority individuals, between-person associations of discriminatory experiences and substance use were not significant, whereas more discriminatory experiences were significantly associated with more nicotine, alcohol, and drug use within the person . This highlights the potential limitations of between-person methods (nomothetic) that predominate in research and suggests that the within-person level (idiographic) precision health approach may be highly relevant to target reductions in sedentary time and other unhealthy behaviors . An important advantage of the EMA methodology is its ability to examine the frequency of racial discrimination experiences in real time and assess the impact of the experiences in a microtemporal relationship (eg, repeated assessments across minutes or hours). In our study, participants reported, on average, 0.61 overt racial discrimination experiences per day, and most participants experienced substantial daily microaggressions. The reported frequency of racial discrimination varies widely across studies . In earlier cross-sectional studies using retrospective measures, discrimination was reported to occur only infrequently ; however, recent studies using EMA or other types of daily diaries have revealed that discrimination may occur multiple times per day. For example, in a study using EMA, African American participants reported about 2 experiences per day of racism . In another study using EMA among African American adolescents , participants reported 5 experiences of racial discrimination per day when comprehensive measures of racial discrimination were used, including social media, vicarious, and teasing experiences, along with the more commonly measured individual and general forms of racial discrimination. In several studies of psychological stress, not specific to racial discrimination-related stress in the general population, episodic stress predicts less PA, more sedentary behaviors, and reduced total energy expenditure . Consistent with these studies, we found that major lifetime discrimination (from a retrospective measure) was significantly associated with lower total energy expenditure measured by the accelerometer. However, EMA-reported microaggressions were not associated with PA outcomes in our within-or between-person analyses. The nonsignificant relationship may be because of the small sample size and lack of variability in terms of the frequency of microaggression experiences within and across days. Overall, our participants reported frequent daily microaggressions, which may not have had a significant impact on their daily PA levels. However, the observed effect size based on standardized β coefficients  suggests the need for more studies to examine the determinants of PA and sedentary behaviors with a larger sample size and a longer assessment period. Consistent with other studies , retrospectively measured exposure to race-based discrimination over a lifetime (assessed at baseline) was significantly associated with more depressive symptoms and with more daily microaggression experiences measured by EMA. Given the different data collection methods (retrospective surveys vs EMA) in this study, we could not determine the temporal relationship between racial discrimination or microaggression and depressive symptoms, and the findings may reflect a reverse causal relationship (eg, people with more depressive symptoms or such traits may perceive more microaggression). However, lagged effects of racial discrimination on depressive symptoms in subsequent days were reported among African Americans and Hispanics or Latinos in other studies , suggesting that individuals may not easily or fully recover from discrimination, and racial discrimination may have lasting effects on mental health . Taken together, our findings highlight the important association between racial discrimination and mental health. Furthermore, future studies examining additional psychological factors, such as traits and personality, are needed to determine both the concurrent and lagged effects of racial discrimination on health and health behaviors. Such studies may inform the development of individualized interventions that can buffer the harmful effects of racial discrimination on health. Strengths and Limitations This study had several limitations. Although we found similar trends in within-or between-person effects on sedentary behaviors and PA, compared with other studies of general psychological stress, our small sample size offers limited evidence supporting racial discrimination as an antecedent to sedentary behaviors or PA. EMA minimizes recall bias and errors. However, it is also possible that our study findings may have been influenced by vigilance to discrimination from the repetitive assessment involved in EMA. In addition, the high CES-D scores observed in our participants may have influenced the associations with perceived racial discrimination or PA. Although findings are mixed, previous studies have shown that neighborhood environments such as walkability, safety, or crime were associated with individuals' PA levels in the general population . We obtained walkability (Walk Score) and crime index data based on participants' zip codes (data not shown); however, the predominantly Black neighborhoods in our sample showed a lack of variability. Future studies with measures of social environment, segregation, and perceived neighborhood environments, in addition to objective built environments, would be helpful in understanding the relationship between PA and relevant correlates. Owing to the exploratory nature of our pilot study with the scarcity of EMA studies of racial discrimination, we conducted a 2-hour within-person, prompt-level analysis; however, assessment may need longer time frames to determine the association between racial discrimination and PA levels. In addition, using event-contingent sampling (ie, EMA is reported when a discrimination event occurs) may be helpful in determining the frequency of racial discrimination; one caveat is that it may not accurately measure events if many participants forget to report them (missing EMA). In addition, our study included only in-person and individual racial discrimination experiences. Including web-based (eg, communication in social media) and vicarious discrimination experiences (eg, watching traumatic videos of police brutality) may provide more valid frequency estimates . Future efforts should include studies with a large sample, more extensive racial discrimination measures, and EMA sampling to determine the optimal frequency of EMA to accurately capture discriminatory experiences and to examine its relationship with health behaviors. Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable insights into examining the within-person effects of racial discrimination on health behaviors and suggests the need to examine a more complex relationship between racial discrimination and lifestyle behaviors with time-varying factors. There is a growing emphasis on within-person examination of health behaviors and psychosocial correlates and on the importance of leveraging these data to develop personalized, just-in-time interventions . Examining this daily process using a within-person approach has the potential to elucidate the mechanisms of which racial discrimination may have on health and health behaviors and to guide the development of personalized interventions for increasing PA and decreasing depressive symptoms in racial ethnic minorities. Conclusions In conclusion, the results of this study highlight the utility and feasibility of a within-person approach to target reductions in sedentary time and improvements in PA associated with daily racial discrimination by using EMA and an objective measure of PA. Further studies are needed to confirm the observed findings in light of the limitations of this study, including its small sample size. A precision health approach that incorporates between-person associations and accounts for within-person variations in the relationship between racial discrimination and health behaviors is warranted to mitigate race-based health disparities.

27,27,Real-Life Self-Control is Predicted by Parietal Activity During Preference Decision Making: A Brain Decoding Analysis,"Despite its relevance for health and education, the neurocognitive mechanism of real-life self-control is largely unknown. While recent research revealed a prominent role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the computation of an integrative value signal, the contribution and relevance of other brain regions for real-life self-control remains unclear. To investigate neural correlates of decisions in line with long-term consequences and to assess the potential of brain decoding methods for the individual prediction of real-life self-control, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging during preference decision making with ecological momentary assessment of daily self-control in a large community sample (N = 266). Decisions in line with long-term consequences were associated with increased activity in bilateral angular gyrus and precuneus, regions involved in different forms of perspective taking, such as imagining one's own future and the perspective of others. Applying multivariate pattern analysis to the same clusters revealed that individual patterns of activity predicted the probability of real-life self-control. Brain activations are discussed in relation to episodic future thinking and mentalizing as potential mechanisms mediating real-life self-control.","[""Self-control"", ""Value-based decision making"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Ecological validity"", ""Brain decoding""]",10.3758/s13415-021-00913-w,"Introduction Self-control, the ability to adjust behavior according to longterm goals despite short-term temptations, is associated with a wide range of positive real-life outcomes . According to the valuation model of self-control , self-controlled choice involves a dynamic integration process wherein subjective value for each choice option is calculated by integrating various short-and long-term gains and costs. The resulting integrated value signal reflects the individual's preferences at the moment of decision and biases the individual toward the enactment of the most valued option. We thus assume that individual differences in self-control reflect the relative weight with which long-term consequences enter this value integration process . While empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that self-control is finally based on a valuation signal computed in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), it remains unclear how exactly this valuation signal is computed. According to dual-process theories, self-control often is reduced to the inhibition of impulsive behaviors . While inhibitory control is certainly one route of selfcontrol, there are multiple alternative strategies of successful self-control , e.g., by anticipation of future outcomes, which is necessary to pursue long-term goals . At the neurobiological level, there is large consensus that cognitive control regions, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), play a major role in self-control. Previous research revealed that the inferior frontal gyrus is critical for response inhibition  and that the dorsolateral PFC is involved in active goal-maintenance . With regard to the valuation model of self-control, it has been suggested that the role of the dorsolateral PFC is the top-down modulation of the value signal in the vmPFC in order to strengthen values assigned to long-term goals . Less is known about the contribution of nonexecutive parietal brain regions to self-control. One possibility includes that parietal brain regions, such as the posterior inferior parietal lobe and precuneus, mediate self-control by the representation of future outcomes . This also could involve interactions with the dorsolateral PFC, for instance a vivid imagination of future consequences might increase the representation of long-term goals in the dorsolateral PFC. While significant progress has been made in identifying the neural basis of self-control in the laboratory , the ecological validity of neural correlates of in-laboratory self-control remains largely unknown. However, ecological validity has become increasingly debated since concerns were raised that taskbased measures of self-control lack reliability  and are not meaningfully associated with self-reported self-control . So far, only a few studies in self-control research have addressed the trade-off between experimental control and ecological validity by combining neuroimaging methods with the assessment of real-life behavior by using smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) . Recently, we used a ROI-approach to investigate, whether the weight with which long-term consequences modulate value signals in the vmPFC during decision making is predictive of individual differences in real-life self-control . Here, we go beyond previous work in several ways. First, while we previously investigated the modulation of value signals in the vmPFC and its role in predicting real-life self-control, the present paper focusses on the role of prefrontal and parietal cortex regions, which are involved in inhibitory control and future-directed thinking. Second, going beyond the ROI-based approach in our previous publication, we examined whether it is possible to use braindecoding methods to predict real-life self-control at the individual level. An exploratory whole-brain analysis was conducted contrasting decisions in line with longterm consequences and decisions in line with short-term consequences, a contrast that has not been analyzed so far. We hypothesized that decisions associated with long-term consequences in the laboratory should be associated either with stronger activation of lateral prefrontal brain regions (supporting the role of inhibitory control for self-control) and/or, alternatively, with activation in the posterior inferior parietal lobe and precuneus (in support of other self-control strategies, such as value modulation via the anticipation of future outcomes). To predict real-life self-control at the individual level, multivariate pattern analysis  was applied to the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and combined with EMA of real-life self-control. We hypothesized that neural correlates of preference decision making in the laboratory should predict individual differences in real-life self-control. Method Participants A total of 338 young adults (aged 19-27 years; 199 females) were recruited from a random community sample from the city of Dresden, Germany, for a multiyear, longitudinal research project on the role of cognitive control and decision making in self-control failures and addictive behaviors (for previous publications from this project, see . Note that the sample size in the present study is larger than in our previous neuroimaging publications , as in the meantime, data acquisition from all participants enrolled in this project has been completed. Participants were paid 40 Euro for completing the scanning session and EMA. All participants provided written, informed consent. The study was approved by the local research Ethics Committee of the Technische Universität Dresden (EK45022012) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were excluded if they had neurological conditions that might affect cognition or motor performance, magnetic-resonance contraindications, lifetime schizophrenia or psychotic symptoms, bipolar disorder, and if they had somatoform, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive or eating disorders, or major depression in the past 4 weeks. For the current fMRI study, all participants who had completed the fMRI session (N = 313) were included. After data collection, 25 participants were excluded due to excessive movement (>3 mm in translation or rotation) or high amount of missed trials (more than 15%, i.e., 18 trials or more than 9 missed trials in a row) during acquisition of fMRI data, and 7 participants were excluded due to floor or ceiling effects (i.e., no trials indicating self-control success/self-control failure). FMRI data were thus analyzed for the remaining 281 participants. Due to incomplete acquisition of EMA data for nine participants and zero reported conflicts for six participants, the final sample for the prediction of real-life self-control was 266 participants (aged 19-27 years; 157 females). Assessment of real-life self-control via ecological momentary assessment Real-life self-control failures were assessed by using an EMA procedure adapted from  (Figure ). Participants were provided smartphones equipped for EMA (using the customizable application movisens XS), which they carried with them continuously for 7 days. Eight alarms per day were issued randomly within a 14-hour time window starting at either 8, 9, or 10 a.m., depending on participants' habitual waking hours. Upon accepting an alarm, participants were prompted to complete a short questionnaire on the device to examine the occurrence of self-control conflicts in the hour preceding the alarm. First, they were asked whether they had experienced a desire within the past hour. If they reported a desire, they were asked to indicate the strength of the desire on a scale from 1 (very weak) to 6 (very strong), to select the respective type of desire from a list of 19 categories (e.g., eating, sleeping, drinking, smoking, etc.), and to indicate whether the desire was in conflict with a superordinate goal. If they reported a conflict, participants were asked to rate the conflict strength on a six-point scale from 1 (very weak) to 6 (very strong), to indicate whether they had attempted to resist the desire, and whether they had enacted the desired behavior. The questionnaire is summarized in Appendix A (Table ). Depending on response rates, each participant completed up to 56 questionnaires. Self-control failures were operationalized as occasions where participants enacted conflict-laden desires. For each participant, the probability of a self-control failure in a conflict situation was computed as the relative amount of self-control failures in conflict situations. Self-reports of trait self-control Participants' self-evaluations of trait self-control were assessed with a German version of the Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS; . The BSCS comprises 13 items (e.g., ""I am good at resisting temptation""; ""People would say that I have iron self-discipline""; ""Sometimes I can't stop myself from doing something, even if I know it is wrong""). High BSCS scores indicate high levels of trait self-control. Preference decision-making task Neural correlates of preference decision making were measured using BOLD-fMRI in a task  in which participants indicated their subjective preference for a broad range of daily behaviors (Figure ). Participants were shown short, verbal descriptions of 40 actions with potentially diverging short-and long-term consequences (e.g., ""drink alcohol""; ""prepare for exam""; ""play videogames""; or ""clean kitchen""; for a list including all items see Table  in Appendix B). Participants were instructed to imagine for each item a realistic choice situation and then to decide whether they would perform the action and indicate the strength of their preference on a four-point scale (strong yes; yes; no; strong no). To facilitate interpretation of the subsequent parametric analysis of decision value, the scale was recoded, so that higher numbers indicated higher decision value (strong no = −2; no = −1; yes = 1; strong yes = 2). Each trial consisted of the visual presentation of the item (3.5 s) followed by a fixation cross (jittered interstimulus-interval [ISI] of 5 s, 6 s, or 7 s; average ISI = 6 s), yielding an average trial length of 9.5 s. Note that once participants indicated their response, the item remained visible on the screen until the end of the 3.5-s stimulation period. Forty different items were randomized and repeated three times, yielding a total number of 120 trials and a total duration of 19 min. After fMRI-scanning, participants rated the same 40 items with regard to the value of their anticipated short-and longterm consequences on a six-point scale from ""very positive"" to ""very negative"" (Figure ); see Appendix C for more details about the rating procedure. The scale was recoded so that higher numbers indicated more positive ratings (very negative = −3, very positive = 3). Ratings were performed after the fMRI task to avoid that the decision process during fMRI was influenced by ratings. Based on these ratings, for each participant items were individually classified as items with divergent consequences when the participant assigned a positive value to anticipated short-term consequences and a negative value to anticipated long-term consequences, or vice versa. Decisions on trials with divergent consequences were further classified as decisions in line with long-term consequences when the participant declined a decision associated with negative long-term outcomes or accepted a decision associated with positive long-term outcomes. fMRI Data Acquisition Functional images were acquired using a T2*-weighted, gradient-echo, echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TE = 25 ms, TR = 2 s, flip angle 78°, slice thickness 3.2 mm, matrix 64 x 64, FOV 19.2 cm, in-plane resolution 3 x 3 mm) on a Siemens MAGNETOM Trio A Tim 3 T scanner with a 32-channel head coil. Thirty-four axial slices, oriented parallel to the AC-PC line covering the whole brain, were acquired. In addition, high-resolution anatomical images were acquired (TE = 2.26 ms, TR = 1,900 ms, flip angle 9°, matrix 256 x 256, FOV 25.6 cm, 591 sagittal slices, slice thickness 1 mm). fMRI Data Analysis SPM12 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) and Matlab2018b were used for preprocessing and statistical analyses of fMRI data. paper and pencil questionnaire: Participants were asked to rate the previously seen items with regard to their anticipated short-and long-term consequences on six-point scales ranging from very positive (+++) to very negative (−−−). By combining decisions and ratings, it was possible to define decisions in line with long-term consequences and decisions in line with short-term consequences Each participant's structural image was co-registered with the functional images. Functional images were slice time corrected, spatially realigned, and unwarped using field maps. Spatial normalization to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space was performed using the unified segmentation approach , which is based on the separation of gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (voxel-size 3 mm). Images were spatially smoothed using an 8-mm, full-width, half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian filter. For baseline correction data were high-pass-filtered with a cutoff period of 128 s. A general linear model (GLM) of blood oxygen leveldependent activity was computed, including eight task regressors: (i) decisions in line with long-term consequences A (participant declines activity with positive short-term but negative long-term consequences), (ii) decisions in line with long-term consequences B (participant accepts activity with negative short-term but positive long-term consequences), (iii) decisions associated with short-term consequences A (participant accepts activity with positive short-term but negative longterm consequences), (iv) decisions associated with shortterm consequences B (participant declines activity with negative short-term but positive long-term consequences), (v) decisions all-positive enactment (participant accepts activity with positive short-term and positive long-term consequences), (vi) decisions all-negative no enactment (participant declines activity with negative short-term and negative longterm consequences), (vii) decisions all-positive no enactment (participant declines activity with positive short-term and positive long-term consequences), (viii) decisions all-negative enactment (participant accepts activity with negative short-term and negative long-term consequences). For subsequent analyses regressors (i) and (ii) were collapsed to indicate decisions in line with long-term consequences; similarly, regressors (iii) and (iv) were collapsed to indicate decisions in line with shortterm consequences. The six motion parameters estimated during realignment, session constants, and missed trials were included as regressors of no interest. Moreover, regressors of interest were convolved with a canonical form of the hemodynamic response. In exploratory whole-brain first-level analyses, decisions associated with long-term consequences were contrasted with decisions associated with short-term consequences for each subject (decisions long-term > decisions short-term). These contrast images were then entered into second-level analyses, and paired t-test were used to test for effects between conditions. Clusters were obtained using a whole-brain voxel-threshold of p < 0.001 with a minimum cluster size of 270 mm 3 . Family-wise error (FWE) correction based on random field theory was applied at the voxel-level (p < 0.05). Prediction of real-life self-control failures by multivariate pattern analysis Clusters obtained during second-level analyses (decisions long-term > decisions short-term) were used as ROIs for multivariate pattern analysis. Please note that by using test set data for feature selection, the resulting coefficients will provide an accurate estimate of the true, error-free effect size; however, this approach may lead to a better performance compared with using genuinely new data for feature selection. For the multivariate pattern analysis, the same images (normalized to MNI space, 8-mm FWHM smoothing) were used as for the univariate analysis. To predict the probability of real-life self-control failures based on individual activity patterns in these ROIs, L1-regularized logistic regression (implemented via the Matlab function lassoglm) was used. A leave-one-subject-out crossvalidation routine was used, where a single subject's data were excluded. Then, a model was trained with all of the remaining subjects' voxel-wise data. The model was applied to the left-out subject (see the Supplemental Material for an alternative, k-fold, cross-validation procedure). This routine was repeated for each subject in the final sample (N = 266), generating cross-validated predictions. To assess the predictive power of the model, predicted real-life self-control failures were correlated with observed self-control failures. The L1-regularization parameter λ was optimized via nested leave-one-subject-out crossvalidation loops on the respective training data. This computationally expensive parameter selection procedure was implemented to provide unbiased parameter estimates . The λ parameter was optimized along the parameter range {2 −8 , 2 −8.5 , 2 −9 , ⋯, 2 −13.5 }. Statistical significance of the correlation between predicted and observed real-life self-control failures was determined by a permutation test. To sample from the null distribution, the predicted real-life self-control failures values were randomly permutated and correlated with the actual real-life self-control failure values 1,000,000 times. The p-value was computed as the fraction of correlation values sampled from the null distribution that was larger than or equal to the actual correlation value. Results Decisions in line with long-term consequences during the preference decision-making task On average, items involved diverging consequences in 61.83 (SD = 22.08, range = 5-110) of 120 total trials, i.e., in 51.53% of trials (SD = 18.4). In 27.26 trials (SD = 16.17, range = 2-80), i.e., in almost 50% of the trials with diverging consequences, participants indicated that they would make a decision in line with long-term consequences in the imagined situation (enacting a behavior that was rated to have negative short-term consequences, or not enacting a behavior that was rated to have positive short-term consequences). In 34.57 trials, (SD = 14.91, range = 3-79), participants indicated that they would make a decision in line with short-term consequences. The average proportion of missed responses was low (M = 2.59, SD = 3.0). The number of trials with diverging consequences during the task was positively correlated with the number of real-life conflicts investigated using EMA (r = 0.168; p = 0.006; N = 266). The number of decisions in line with short-term consequences during the task was positively correlated with the number of real-life self-control failures, investigated using EMA (r = 0.205; p = 0.001; N = 266). The number of in-task decisions in line with short-term consequences was negatively correlated with trait self-control in terms of BSCS scores (r = −0.253; p = 0.000; N = 280). Real-life self-control during ecological momentary assessment On average, participants responded to 43.97 (SD = 8.98) of the 56 issued alarms (78.5%) and reported 31.85 (SD = 9.5) desires, 11.61 (SD = 7.28) of which were conflict-laden (36.5%). Of the conflict-laden desires, 6.17 (SD = 4.82) were enacted (53.1% self-control failures). The number of real-life self-control failures (r = −0.156; p = 0.011; N = 266) was negatively correlated with trait self-control. Neural correlates of decisions in line with long-term consequences and the prediction of individual reallife self-control by multivariate pattern analysis Contrasting decisions in line with long-term consequences and decisions in line with short-term consequences revealed three clusters where activity was stronger for decisions in line with long-term consequences compared with decisions in line with short-term consequences: bilateral angular gyrus (right hemisphere peak: [54, −61, 32], t = 4.71, p < 0.05 FWEcorrected at the voxel-level; left hemisphere peak: [−45, −67, 41], t = 4.58, p < 0.05 FWE-corrected at the voxel-level) and precuneus (peak: , t = 4.42, p < 0.05 FWEcorrected at the voxel-level) (Figure ). Importantly, applying multivariate pattern analysis to those three clusters revealed that individual patterns of activity also predicted the probability of real-life self-control failures significantly above chance (r = 0.243, p < 0.00005; RMSE = 0.32) (Figures ; see Figure  in the Supplemental Material for consistent results using k-fold cross-validation). See the Supplemental Material for two additional post-hoc MVPA investigating the contribution of the precuneus versus (bilateral) angular gyrus clusters and for the prediction of real-life self-control failures based on univariate analyses. Discussion The present study pursued two goals: (i) to identify neural correlates of decisions in line with long-term consequences in the laboratory; and (ii) to investigate the potential of brain decoding measures for the prediction of real-life self-control at the individual level. There were two main results: First, there was increased activation for decisions in line with long-term consequences in bilateral angular gyrus and precuneus. Second, multivariate pattern analysis revealed that individual activation patterns in the same brain regions predicted individual real-life self-control examined via EMA. Activity in the precuneus and angular gyrus has been associated with a wide range of cognitive abilities. The precuneus is involved in visuo-spatial imagery, episodic memory retrieval, self-processing operations, such as first-person perspective taking and experience of agency and self-consciousness (for a review see . The angular gyrus is involved in social cognition, default mode network functions, semantic processing, word reading and comprehension, number processing, memory retrieval, attention and spatial cognition, and conflict resolution (for a review see Seghier, 2013). Interestingly, both the precuneus and the angular gyrus have been associated with the anticipation of future outcomes , a cognitive function that is necessary for episodic future thinking, i.e., the mental simulation of experiences that may occur in one's personal future . Whereas precuneus and angular gyrus have been identified as parts of the core network of episodic future thinking, their specific contributions remain unknown . Previous research suggests that the precuneus is involved in self-processing, namely first-person perspective taking . Moreover, the role of the angular gyrus has been implicated in future-oriented thinking, i.e., the representation of action outcomes and goaldirected action . We suggest that, although speculative, episodic future thinking could be the mechanism that enables self-control by increasing the impact of long-term consequences during decision making. This view is consistent with recent evidence that the relative weight with which long-term outcomes modulate value signals in the vmPFC predict individual differences in real-life self-control . Further support comes from a transcranial magnetic stimulation study that showed that disturbing the posterior temporoparietal junction (including the angular gyrus) increases delay discounting, suggesting a causal involvement of the temporoparietal junction in implementing future-oriented behavior . Finally, behavioral evidence has shown that episodic future thinking reduces delay discounting, thus biasing dietary decision away from immediate food rewards and toward longer-term health goals related to weight loss discounting . Analogous effects were observed with regard to consumption of alcohol and cigarettes . Note that the angular gyrus and the precuneus are not only involved in taking the perspective of one's future self (i.e., episodic future thinking) but also in taking the perspective of other people, which is investigated with theory-of-mind or mentalizing tasks . In particular, it has been suggested that the angular gyrus, which is a key node of the social brain , is involved in reasoning about other people's minds . Thus brain activity observed in the present study may reflect that participants considered how they would be judged by other people if they accepted behaviors of low social desirability, such as ""to take drugs,"" ""to cheat on somebody,"" ""to gossip about someone,"" or alternatively, if they declined behaviors of high social desirability, such as ""to save money,"" ""to study for an exam,"" and ""to get up early"" (see Table  in Appendix B for all task items). Because trait selfcontrol and social desirability are substantially correlated , it is plausible that participants who considered how they might be judged by others made more self-controlled decisions in the task and in real-life. In summary, the observed activation of angular gyrus and precuneus can be explained by different forms of perspective taking, such as imagining one's own future and the perspective of others . Another brain region that has been associated with episodic future thinking is the medial PFC . Using monetary intertemporal choice paradigms, it has been shown that farsighted decisions were mediated by increased prefrontal-medial-temporal interactions  and that the medial PFC mediates the impact of episodic future thinking by representing the reward magnitude of envisaged events . The fact that no medial-prefrontal brain activations were observed in the present study might be explained by crucial differences in experimental designs. Note that, although the task required participants to make real choices between temptations and long-term goals, these decisions were still hypothetical and were not followed by real consequences. This is in contrast to previous studies that investigated value-based decision making  and might explain why in the present study, brain activations were observed in regions related to episodic future thinking but not in the dorsolateral PFC and vmPFC. However, using the same task, but focusing on a different contrast, we recently found that vmPFC activity was parametrically associated with decision value and that the modulation of the vmPFC signal by long-term consequences was associated with real-life self-control . Finally, the present study contributes to the investigation of individual differences in real-life self-control. While previous studies focused on the role of cognitive control and response inhibition in real-life self-control , only recently the contribution of valuation processes were examined. Using the same task as in the present study,  showed that real-life self-control was predicted by ventromedial PFC activity encoding the value of anticipated future outcomes. The present study adds to this literature on real-life self-control and is consistent with the idea that episodic future thinking (i.e., imagining one's own future), mediated by the precuneus and angular gyrus, might be an additional important aspect in the decision process before the final value integration in the ventromedial PFC. However, although plausible, this interpretation is still speculative, because the present study does not provide direct evidence for the involvement of episodic future thinking in reallife self-control. Note that our results are compatible with the view that alternative forms of perspective taking, such as imagining the perspective of others, contribute to self-control. Future studies should combine EMA with more restricted experimental designs to clarify the roles of different forms of perspective taking in self-control. To assess the ecological validity of multivariate brain patterns, we investigated associations between those patterns and daily self-control failures measured via EMA . Compared with traditional paper-pencil self-reports EMA has strengths (e.g., it does not rely on memory, no need for aggregation, no artificial context) and weaknesses (measurement reactivity, participant burden, drop-out rate). Note that reallife self-control (EMA) and trait self-control (BSCS) were significantly correlated, but the size of this correlation is small. This is not surprising considering the different levels of analysis (trait self-control vs. situational self-control). Note that multivariate brain patterns accounted for approximately 6% in variance in the EMA data. The fact that most of the variance in the EMA data remained unexplained is not surprising given the noisiness of the data. Our finding is important, because it illustrates how neuroimaging can add to the understanding of self-control. A potential limitation of the task used in this study relates to the fact that participants were free to imagine for each item a realistic choice situation. Depending on the imagined situation, participants may make a decision consistent with shortterm consequences that would not necessarily require selfcontrol (e.g., drink alcohol at dinner) or consistent with long-term consequences that would likely require selfcontrol (e.g., do not drink alcohol before driving). Thus, although the correlations of in-task decisions in line with participants' ratings of long-term consequences with trait and real-life self-control suggest an involvement of self-control, we cannot be sure that participants experienced conflict or self-control during the task. Even if participants had not experienced self-control conflicts in our task, this would not invalidate the key finding that real-life self-control was associated with brain activity on trials, on which participants' expressed preferences that were congruent with the subjective value of long-term (rather than the value of short-term) consequences of imagined behavioural options.

28,28,Real-time associations between discrimination and anxious and depressed mood among sexual and gender minorities: The moderating effects of lifetime victimization and identity concealment,"Background: Sexual and gender minorities (SGM) experience higher rates of depression and anxiety, which are linked to higher rates of discrimination and victimization. SGM individuals may conceal their SGM identities to decrease discrimination and victimization exposure; however, these experiences still occur, and concealment itself is often associated with greater anxiety and depression. However, it remains unclear whether lifetime victimization and identity concealment moderate the effect of day-to-day discrimination, which we evaluated in the current study using ecological momentary assessment (EMA).Methods: Fifty SGM participants (Mage=21.82, SD=4.70; 84% White) completed baseline assessment (e.g., concealment and lifetime victimization) followed by EMA of daily discrimination and anxious and depressed mood for 14 days.Results: As hypothesized, daily discrimination predicted momentary increases in anxious and depressed mood, b = .34, p < .001. Notably, these effects were more pronounced among individuals who reported higher levels of identity concealment, b = .25, p < .001, and previous SGM-based victimization experiences (marginally), b = .18, p = .05. Main effects of cumulative lifetime victimization and identity concealment, measured at baseline, were associated with higher ratings of anxious and depressed mood over the two-week study.Discussion: While identity concealment may reduce exposure to discrimination and victimization, we found that concealment and prior victimization predict heightened reactivity to daily discrimination experiences. Additional research is needed to further explicate real-time effects of minority stress exposure, and to develop interventions that may mitigate risk among SGM individuals with prior victimization exposure and higher levels of identity concealment in particular.","[""LGBT"", ""minority stress"", ""depression"", ""anxiety"", ""ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1037/sgd0000371,"expectations of rejection, identity concealment) minority stressors that give rise to poorer mental health outcomes . Numerous studies document and lend support for this model, and it is well documented that SGM individuals experience high rates of SGMbased discrimination and victimization daily and throughout life . Even starting from a young age, repeated exposure to victimization has been shown to have a cumulative effect on mental health among SGM individuals . Consistently, we expect that victimization has a cumulative effect on SGM individuals with respect to anxiety and depression over time, and potentially sensitizes them to subsequent, daily and distal stress exposures. Beyond the well-documented effects of SGM-based discrimination and victimization on anxiety and depression, an important proximal process within the minority stress framework is SGM identity concealment, which has garnered increased research attention in recent years . Identity concealment is motivated by a desire to safeguard against real and anticipated threats (i.e., to personal safety or integrity; , and may, in fact, be protective against victimization and discrimination . Of course, concealment can come in many forms, ranging from concealment of SGM or other intersecting identities (e.g., concealment of veteran identity among LGBTQ peers), attraction, gender expression/performance , or health and HIV status . Although each is associated with elevated internalizing symptoms, such as anxiety and depression , we focus on SGM identity concealment in the current study. Responding to felt pressure to conceal one's SGM identity may serve important safety functions for the SGM person. Yet, anticipated rejection or hostility from others is associated with increased hypervigilance, negative self-appraisals, and psychological distress . In addition, discrimination occurs, or is perceived to occur, regardless of individuals' attempts to conceal their identity . Given the elevated risk for anxious and depressed mood among individuals with higher levels of concealment (see  for a notable exception and gender differences), it is possible that discrimination also has a more pronounced effect on anxious and depressed mood among SGM individuals who conceal their identities. Unfortunately, much of the research on minority stress and mental health is cross-sectional in nature. Even the longitudinal studies that exist are limited in terms of being able to generalize to the daily or within-day level of analysis or discern temporal associations among these variables . However, daily diary studies have provided support for the minority stress models by demonstrating the effects of daily minority stressors on anxiety and depression (e.g., . However, these studies only assess minority stressors, such as discrimination, once a day. As such, less is currently known regarding the effects of daily minority stressors, such as SGM-based discrimination, as they relate to momentary anxious or depressed mood. Current study Ecological momentary assessment is an intensive longitudinal data collection method that allows researchers to collect data in real/near-real time. It is ideal for conducting research on time-varying experiential and psychological processes, which can vary considerably over relatively brief periods of time . Using EMA data from an existing data set , the purpose of this study was to build on our previous research by examining the (1) momentary associations between daily discrimination exposure and subsequent anxious and depressed mood among SGM individuals, and (2) the moderating effects of cumulative lifetime SGMbased victimization and identity concealment on these associations. We hypothesized that daily discrimination would predict anxious and depressed mood ratings, over and above other forms of mistreatment (i.e., ""general mistreatment"" including events not attributable to SGM identity). We further hypothesized that the effect of daily discrimination would be more pronounced among individuals reporting higher rates of lifetime SGM-based victimization and identity concealment. While we acknowledge the critical need to consider simultaneously the impact of proximal stress processes (e.g., anticipated or internalized stigma) in future research, we designed this particular study to evaluate the effects of distal stressors on event-based anxious and depressed mood. Method Participants Study participants were recruited from the University of Montana via hardcopy recruitment fliers and a cloud-based participant recruiting software program, SONA (see . Eligibility criteria specified individuals 18 or older, identification as nonheterosexual (identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, queer, questioning, fluid, or endorsed a non-heterosexual orientation) or denial of being exclusively heterosexual at baseline on a yes/no question, or identification as a transgender or gender diverse person (e.g., gender queer, gender fluid), regardless of sexual orientation. Procedure This study was approved by the University of Montana Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided informed consent prior to participating. Eligible participants who expressed interest in participating in the EMA study were contacted by the principal investigator (PI) and invited to attend a 90-minute orientation and questionnaire session. During orientation, participants were provided instruction regarding proper use of EMA devices, as well as an overview of the EMA survey format and nature of the questions asked. Each participant was provided a Samsung Galaxy EMA device, charger, informational packet, and contact information for the PI and designated research assistants for technological support. We provided devices for this study to ensure a uniform user experience and to circumvent compatibility issues between participants' personal devices and our EMA application (programmed using B4A for Android). Data were stored separately from survey questions and in a hidden, de-identified folder on each device, and later downloaded and deleted from the device upon return to the PI. While some participants reported having to ""get used to"" carrying around a second device (all but one had personal smart phones), everyone reported that use of the device, and the study procedures, were feasible and acceptable . Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing whether compliance would have differed if participants used their personal devices. Participants were prompted randomly within two-hour intervals (between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m.), six times per day, for two weeks. Each prompt could be ""snoozed"" twice for ten minutes each. At each prompt, participants were asked to record experiences, mood, and behaviors since their last prompt, or within the last two to three hours in the event that they did not complete their last prompt. Missed prompts were coded as missing and participants were not prompted again until the next two-hour measurement window. Participation was staggered throughout the recruitment phase; however, each wave of data collection began the Thursday following orientation and continued for 14 days. Each participant was given $10 for completing baseline assessment and orientation, $50 at the end of the EMA study, and course credit, if applicable. Baseline Measures Sociodemographic variables-Prescreening and baseline surveys included questions about participants' age, educational background, race/ethnicity, relationship status, sexual orientation, and gender identity (""two-step method""; . Lifetime victimization.-We measured lifetime SGM-based victimization using an established 10-item measure . Although validity and reliability data are lacking, this face valid measure in the public domain was developed to assess the frequency of victimization experiences throughout life, and has been used successfully in previous LGBTQ health research . Participants were instructed to record how many times each listed experience had occurred during their lifetime (e.g., ""Been threatened with physical violence?"" or ""Been punched, hit, kicked, or beaten?"") on a 0 = ""Never/not applicable"" to 5 = ""20 or more times"" scale (Cronbach's α = .86). Concealment.-We measured concealment using an adapted version of the 11-item Outness Inventory . The 11-item Outness Inventory has demonstrated strong validity , including convergent and discriminant validity with other measures . We added two items to assess concealment with respect to ""my school peers"" and ""school staff and professors."" All items were assessed using a 1 = ""person definitely does NOT know about your sexual orientation or gender identity"" to 7 = ""person definitely knows about your sexual orientation or gender identity, and it is OPENLY talked about"" scale. We reversed scored items to create the baseline concealment variable (Cronbach's α = .91). EMA Measures Daily discrimination.-Each EMA prompt began by asking participants to report any/all of 12 different mistreatment experiences (e.g., ""Treated with less courtesy or respect than others,"" ""Avoided, excluded, or ignored,"" ""Threatened or harassed;""), since their last prompt, or within the last two-three hours if they missed their last prompt. An open-ended ""other"" option was also included. We used the Everyday Discrimination Measure (EDS;  with three additional items added consistent with related scholarship . The EDS has strong validity  and reliability . Any mistreatment endorsement prompted follow-up about why they believed the experience occurred (i.e., due to their ""sexual orientation,"" ""transgender identity,"" ""race/ethnicity,"" ""gender [male vs female],"" ""disability status,"" ""mental health,"" ""physical health,"" ""other"" [open-ended], or ""none/not applicable""). The EMA design precludes meaningful estimation of internal consistency but reports of mistreatment were reliable over time (see Results). Anxious and depressed mood.-Participants then rated how depressed and anxious they felt via two single-items: ""Depressed (sad, hopeless, or discouraged)"" and ""Anxious (nervous, uneasy, or on edge)"". ""Depressed"" and ""anxious"" wording was chosen for their face validity and synonymous terms in parentheses were adapted from the widely used Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS; . Participants were asked to respond to these items using a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), and in regard to how they felt ""currently"" (i.e., at the time of the prompt). Anxious and depressed mood ratings were highly stable within person and across weeks one and two (see Results). Data Handling and Analytic Strategy SGM-based discrimination included mistreatment attributed to ""sexual orientation"" or ""transgender identity"" (coded 0 = no discrimination, 1 = any discrimination). ""General mistreatment"" experiences included other forms of mistreatment that were not attributed to SGM identity (coded 0 = no mistreatment, 1 = any mistreatment). Concealment and lifetime victimization were grand-mean centered. The dependent variable was the sum of momentary anxious and depressed mood ratings, log transformed to normalize its distribution. Anxious and depressed mood ratings reflected ""current"" mood, whereas discrimination and general mistreatment reflected experiences since participants' last measurement prompt, or within the last two-to-three hours if they missed their last prompt. Thus, the final model reflects contemporaneous associations between experiences from the recent past and current anxious and depressed mood. To provide bivariate correlations between study variables at level 2, we summed daily discrimination, general mistreatment and average anxious and depressed mood ratings over two-weeks, relative to each participants' number of completed prompts. Analytic strategy.-For bivariate correlations at level 2 (Table ), we correlated baseline concealment and victimization with the sum of daily discrimination, general mistreatment and average anxious and depressed mood ratings over participants' respective two-week EMA period. For bivariate correlations at level 1, we correlated momentary anxious and depressed mood ratings, daily discrimination and general mistreatment, time of day, weekday vs. weekend, and baseline concealment and victimization scores. For primary analyses, we specified a multi-level fixed effects model with a random intercept . We evaluated autoregressive AR(1) and spatial correlation structures by comparing model AIC estimates. The autoregressive AR(1) error structure produced the lowest AIC (i.e., better fit to the data) and was retained. We accounted for time of day using five dummy coded variables (10-12pm block served as reference), corresponding to each measurement prompt of the day. We accounted for weekend vs. weekday mood variation by including a binary ""weekend"" variable (Monday-Thursday = 0, Friday-Sunday = 1). Level 1 independent variables of interest included daily SGM-based discrimination and general mistreatment experiences. Level 2 covariates, measured at baseline, included current concealment and cumulative victimization throughout life. We initially included centered level 2 daily discrimination and general mistreatment variables but subsequently removed them upon learning model fit (AIC = 3387.02 vs 3388.35, p = .26), coefficients, and pvalues were similar with vs. without their inclusion. We initially included but subsequently removed the random effect for the slope of daily discrimination to conserve power in light of our small sample. Cross-level interactions of interest included both baseline concealment and lifetime victimization by daily discrimination. We specified the model with fixed slopes and a random intercept, and fit the model using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). Missing data were omitted listwise and all analyses were carried out in R using the nlme package . Interaction plots were created at high and low levels (i.e., median split) of concealment and victimization (moderator variables), using sjPlot , sjmisc , and ggplot2 (Hickman, 2016) in R. Results Descriptive Results Participant ages ranged from 18 to 45 (M = 21.82, SD = 4.70) and the majority of the sample (n = 42) identified as White/Caucasian; the remainder of the sample identified as Native American (n = 1) or having multiple races/ethnicities (e.g., Latino and White; n = 7). Participants identified as female (n = 32), male (n = 10), agender (n = 4), gender queer (n = 2), gender fluid (n = 2), and transgender (n = 1). Nineteen identified as bisexual or pansexual, 10 as lesbian, six as ""other,"" six as heterosexual, and three identified as gay, two as queer, two as questioning, and two as fluid. Five participants had a high school education or equivalent, and most reported having at least some college (n = 37), an Associate's degree (n = 2), Bachelor's degree (n = 12), or a graduate or professional degree (n = 2). Participants reported a wide range of lifetime victimization experiences (M = 1.62, SD = .78, range = 1-4.66) and the average score on the concealment measure was 4.76 (SD = 1.32, range = 1.90-7). Participants completed 68.02% out of 84 prompts (n = 57.17, SD = 14.99; range = 25-78) and compliance decreased between weeks one and two, t(49) = 5.38, p < .001 (M = 30.52 vs. M = 26.62 out of 42 per week). The average time between prompts was two hours and three minutes (SD = 41 min; range = 33 min-3 hrs and 48 min). There were 93 discrimination and 210 general mistreatment experiences reported across participants' completed EMA responses. The proportion of prompts completed in which discrimination and general mistreatment were reported relative to the total number of completed prompts per person was 2.1% (SD = 6.1%) and 5.0% (SD = 5.7%) for discrimination and general mistreatment, respectively. The intra-class correlations for daily discrimination (ICC = .16) and general mistreatment (ICC = .05) suggest that the vast majority of the variability was accounted for at level one (i.e., within person). There were no differences observed regarding reported discrimination between weeks one and two, though general mistreatment was reported less frequently in week two, t(49) = 2.05, p = .046. Reports of discrimination, r(48) = .68, p < .001, and general mistreatment, r(48) = .42, p = .002, were stable/reliable across weeks. Anxious and depressed mood was also stable/ reliable across weeks, r(48) = .74, p < .001. After aggregating momentary anxiety and depression ratings, the overall mean across the two-week study period was 1.32 (SD = 1.37, range = 7.22 on a 0-8 scale). The ICC for anxious and depressed mood ratings was .48, suggesting a relatively even split regarding variability accounted for within versus between participants. Bivariate results As displayed in Table , baseline concealment was inversely associated with lifetime victimization, r(47) = .28, p < .05, which, in turn, was positively associated with average anxious and depressed mood ratings over two weeks, r(48) = .35, p < .05. Level 1 bivariate results in Table  indicate that reports of daily discrimination corresponded with reports of general mistreatment, r(2,823) = .11, p < .001, and occurred more often during the morning hours (10-12pm), r(2,823) = .04, p < .05. Individuals with higher levels of cumulative victimization throughout life reported discrimination more often during across EMA prompts, r(2,823) = .03, p < .05, and discrimination reports were positively correlated with momentary anxious and depressed mood ratings, r(2,813) = .14, p < .001. Higher lifetime victimization, r(2,815) = .18, p < .001, and identity concealment, r(2,749) = .13, p < .001, were positively associated with momentary anxious and depressed mood ratings over time. Primary results Daily discrimination was associated with subsequent increase in momentary anxious and depressed mood, b = .33, p < 0.001, over and above general mistreatment experiences, b = .17, p < 0.001 (see Table ). As hypothesized, there was an interaction between identity concealment and daily experiences of discrimination, b = .25, p < .001, and between daily discrimination and lifetime victimization, b = .19, p = .05 (marginal). The direction of these coefficients suggests that the positive association between daily discrimination and momentary anxious and depressed mood is greater for individuals with higher identity concealment and lifetime victimization scores (see Figures ). In addition, the residual main effects for lifetime victimization, b = .18, p = .03, and concealment, b = .09, p = .06 (marginal), suggest that both are positively associated with higher ratings of anxious and depressed mood over time. Effects suggest lower anxious and depressed mood ratings later in the day compared to morning prompts (marginal effects; See Table ), and on weekends relative to weekdays, b = −.08, p < .001. Discussion This is the first known examination of daily effects of daily SGM-based discrimination as it relates to momentary anxious and depressed mood when considering lifetime victimization and SGM identity concealment. As hypothesized, we found higher anxious and depressed mood ratings for those who had experienced daily discrimination since the last prompt, but this effect was more pronounced for individuals with higher levels of identity concealment and more victimization exposure throughout life. The moderating effect of lifetime victimization, though marginally significant at p = .05, is consistent with  model and previous studies on the cumulative effects of victimization over time . This body of research suggests that previous victimization experiences may sensitize SGM individuals to future exposures and produce heightened emotional reactions to repeated exposures over time. This is consistent with the level 1 bivariate results reported here, indicating that individuals with higher lifetime victimization scores at baseline reported discrimination more frequently over the two-week EMA period. Heightened sensitization might also increase identity concealment demands over time, which may, in turn, exacerbate anxious and depressed mood. Unfortunately, while identity concealment may decrease the likelihood of victimization (consistent with the inverse correlation between concealment and lifetime victimization reported here), identity concealment comes at a cost with respect to anxious and depressed mood. As hypothesized, we found that while daily discrimination predicted subsequent anxious and depressed mood ratings, these effects were more pronounced among individuals with higher levels of identity concealment. It will be important to continue investigating the role of identity concealment in future research, preferably as it manifests in real-time. However, identity concealment is just one of several identified proximal stress processes, and future research would benefit from consideration of other proximal stress processes activated by distal stress exposure, such as internalized and anticipatory stigma. The pronounced effect of daily discrimination among those with previous victimization experiences and higher identity concealment may be explained by the psychological resources required for emotion regulation and effective concealment, which include preoccupation, self-monitoring, and vigilance . Many SGM individuals continue to conceal their identities throughout life while those who are more ""out"" may only do so sparingly and thus, most likely have moments of respite from concealment. Those who are less ""out"" have fewer places to be themselves, thereby employing concealment strategies more frequently and with greater stakes for exposure. Greater deployment of concealment behaviors may be psychologically depleting and affectively impactful, thus contributing to heightened anxious and depressed mood. This may be especially true in the absence of countervailing social support, which may be even more difficult to secure if the SGM person remains concealed. It is also possible that discrimination has more pronounced effects on mood for SGM individuals with higher levels of concealment, as these events might serve to ""out"" them in ways beyond their control, which would undoubtedly lead to increased stress. Moreover, SGM individuals with high levels of concealment may be in particularly invalidating or dangerous environments and may go to great efforts to conceal their identities. If SGM individuals conceal and yet are still are being victimized and discriminated against, they learn that this strategy may not be as effective as they hoped. The net result of this realization could explain higher anxious and depressed mood, as well as feelings of hopelessness, particularly following daily discrimination experiences. It is also possible that concealment and the higher anxious and depressed mood responsiveness observed among people who have greater concealment are accounted for by an unmeasured third variable, such as neuroticism and/or other personality characteristic(s). For example, work by  demonstrated that individuals with higher neuroticism, and lower agreeableness, extroversion, conscientiousness, and openness were more likely to have attempted suicide when they had experienced minority stress. Despite reporting similar rates of minority stress throughout life, individuals with this personality profile were also more likely to conceal their SGM identities. Beyond the interactions observed, main effects of lifetime victimization (marginal; p = .06; statistically significant at the bivariate level) and identity concealment indicate both predicted higher anxious and depressed mood ratings, measured six times per day, over the subsequent two weeks. These directional effects provide evidence of the possibility of chronic mood changes following victimization exposure that are detectable within day and persistent over time. Furthermore, these chronic mood changes may make people more susceptible to perceiving events as discriminatory  and lead to further negative effects following subsequent exposure. The fact that discrimination reported in the same measurement period, which ranged from 33 minutes to three hours and 48 minutes, was associated with current anxious and depressed mood ratings provides directional support to existing daily diary and EMA research. Daily diary research suggests that discrimination can be a daily experience for SGM individuals, and can lead to emotion dysregulation and psychological distress . Although they did not examine distal stress exposure,  extended these findings by demonstrating that proximal stressors (i.e., end-of-day stress and discomfort regarding one's sexual orientation) were related to lower positive affect and higher negative and anxious affect the next day among gay and bisexual men . Their study was the first, but not the only to document the lagged day effects of proximal minority stress (see . The present study extends these findings by demonstrating the daily effects of distal minority stress effects among SGM individuals, and by demonstrating the heightened effect of these experiences relative to other forms of mistreatment. In aggregate, these findings bolster the need to further investigate underlying causal mechanisms. Proximal stressors such as negative self-appraisals, guilt, shame, and social withdrawal are documented cognitive-affective sequelae of distal stress exposure , and represent plausible mechanisms of interest that are also amenable to psychological intervention. Furthermore, proximal stress processes may be differentially activated depending on time-varying social and contextual factors, or vary depending on individuals' co-occurring concerns. For instance, HIV status among SGM may be an additional source of shame and negative affect for some, as demonstrated in a recent EMA study . Clearly further research is needed to explicate the momentary mediational processes leading to minority stress-related anxious and depressed mood, which may give rise to refinement of existing clinical approaches to treating SGM individuals. Researchers have already begun developing interventions that are inclusive of SGM individuals, including web-based interventions (e.g., , and that target minority stress specifically . This study suggests some pathways future intervention development. Specifically, while concealment may initially protect the individual from threat of discrimination or victimization, the individual who conceals may still be exposed to these stressors and, when exposed, the impacts may be even greater. Future research will need to examine the effects of increasing outness among individuals who otherwise would have been inclined to conceal their identities to identify if altering concealment, in turn, reduces anxiety and depression in response to discrimination. Alternatively, we may find that altering concealment among those inclined to conceal has new and unanticipated impacts on mood and anxiety. Further study of mediational factors underling the discrimination-anxiety/depression association might also help identify targets of intervention that may be incorporated into real-time intervention technology . Technology-based interventions have already been developed and tested among individuals struggling with depression and anxiety (e.g., , but have only just begun to address concerns specific to SGM individuals (e.g., . Innovation of this kind could assist SGM individuals in identifying the cognitive and emotional consequences of discrimination, and also in employing strategies to cope with these experiences effectively in the moment. Limitations The current sample was diverse in terms of sexual orientation and gender identity; however, results should be interpreted in light of the fact that they were also predominantly White/ Caucasian, college-educated, and relatively young. By not excluding heterosexually identified participants who reported that they were not exclusively heterosexual currently, we remained inclusion but readers should consider this fact when comparing these results to other studies. Though we attempted to be inclusive of a range of SGM individuals, aggregating SGM individuals in a single study may obscure important subgroup differences. Researchers are encouraged to recruit diverse samples in future research (i.e., in terms race, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic, or ability), and larger samples to evaluate subgroup differences, lagged effects (e.g., within and across days), random effects (i.e., variances around slope estimates to examine and account for heterogeneity), replicability, and generalizability of the current findings. Although used successfully in previous research, the self-report victimization measure used in the current study lacks validity and reliability data, and may lead to underreporting relative to interview-based assessment methods . The Outness Inventory, which was reverse scored to index SGM concealment broadly, is limited to assessment at one point in time. Future research may benefit from assessing concealment more frequently, as concealment demands vary across settings and contexts . It may be helpful to also conceptualize and measure identity concealment as a multidimensional construct comprising cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects . Finally, as with any experience sampling methodology, response burden is a potential limitation and may have resulted in missing data. In order to reduce response burden, we attempted to structure prompts to be as brief as possible while ensuring sufficient coverage of constructs relevant to the parent paper . Unfortunately, the limitation of singleitem self-report measures, especially for constructs as complex and multifaceted as anxiety and depression, is the risk of missing important information. While pursuing related lines of research in the future, investigators are encouraged to consider diagnostic assessments in lieu of, or in addition to, self-report measures, or at least broader assessment of anxiety and depression and their various facets. Conclusion Sexual and gender minority individuals experience high rates of discrimination throughout their lifespan, and for some, on a day-to-day basis. This study demonstrates that daily discriminatory events have immediate effects on momentary anxious and depressed mood ratings that are detectable using ecological momentary assessment. This work also demonstrates that the effects of daily discrimination are more pronounced among individuals with previous victimization experiences and higher levels of identity concealment, unveiling subgroups of SGM individuals who may be more vulnerable to the effects of discrimination. This is not to suggest that concealment is inherently harmful or that individuals should not be mindful of prejudicial attitudes that may warrant concealment; rather, concealment may serve important safety functions for some SGM individuals (e.g., potential for decreased risk of victimization). Further research and support is needed to understand and mitigate the prejudicial attitudes and behaviors of individuals that give rise to elevated concealment demands among SGM individuals. These findings also provide avenues for future research and improved clinical practices that target mental health disparity and promote wellbeing among SGM individuals who experience minority stress. Public Significance Statement: In the current study, we further establish the temporal associations between daily discrimination and anxious and depressed mood among sexual and gender minorities, and extend these findings to the daily level using ecological momentary assessment. We found that daily discrimination has immediate effects on anxious and depressed mood, which was more pronounced among individuals with higher levels of accumulated SGMbased victimization experiences throughout life and higher levels of identity concealment.

29,29,Savoring the present: The reciprocal influence between positive emotions and positive emotion regulation in everyday life,"A growing body of research has investigated the regulation of negative emotions in ecological settings, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying positive emotion regulation in everyday life. Although some evidence suggests that adopting positive strategies is beneficial for emotional well-being, the literature is inconsistent about the effects of positive emotions on subsequent regulatory processes. In the present study, we adopted a two-week ecological momentary assessment to explore the association between positive emotions and positive emotion regulation in daily life. According to our results, the less individuals felt positive emotions at one point, the more they tended to enhance their use of positive strategies from this time to the next, which in turn resulted in subsequent higher levels of positive emotions. This prototype of positive regulation can be seen as a highly adaptive mechanism that makes it possible to compensate for a lack of positive emotions by enhancing the deployment of positive strategies. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","[""Emotions"", ""Mental health and psychiatry"", ""Cognition"", ""Happiness"", ""Attention"", ""Cognitive psychology"", ""Ecology"", ""Undergraduates""]",10.1371/journal.pone.0251561,"Introduction The pursuit of happiness is considered one of the most important life goals of individuals , who intensely seek to create pleasant experiences throughout their lives. Positive emotions (PE) are a core component of well-being because they are not limited to pleasant sensations, but rather produce short-and long-term psychological benefits and improve both physical and mental health . More specifically, PE temporarily extend the scope of attention, cognition and action , which in turn promotes resilience and psychological well-being . Accordingly, people spend most of their time trying to downregulate negative emotions and upregulate positive ones . Emotion regulation is a process through which individuals try to influence their emotional state in order to achieve personal goals . To date, most of the literature has focused on the regulation of negative emotional states. Nevertheless, there is increasing evidence highlighting the crucial role of positive emotion regulation , that is, the set of strategies people implement to create, maintain and enhance PE for two main purposes. First, people upregulate PE for its own sake, that is, to experience pleasurable states and increase happiness . Second, the upregulation of PE has been recognised as a mood repair mechanism, i.e., a process that helps individuals to reduce negative affect and recover from stressful events . Although originally conceptualized for negative emotion, Gross' extended model (2015)  has also been used to understand positive emotion regulation . Accordingly, different types of positive strategies can be deployed in different stages of the emotion generation process: (a) by selecting a situation that is expected to improve affect (situation selection); (b) by actively changing a situation in order to get the most out of it (situation modification); (c) by redirecting the attention towards specific features or details of a situation that might increase positive emotions (attentional deployment); (d) by changing the appraisal of an emotion-eliciting stimulus in order to amplify the associated pleasant state (cognitive change); and (e) by experientially, physiologically, or behaviourally expressing ongoing PE to further increase their intensity (response modulation). These strategies are implemented not only during the experience of a positive emotional state . They might also be used before (i.e., while anticipating a positive event)  or after (i.e., while recalling a positive memory)  the emotiongenerative process . For the purposes of the present study, however, we will mainly focus on the available literature exploring PE regulation in the present. When assessed in naturalistic settings, people use on average a repertoire of sixteen strategies in response to PE . The implementation of positive emotion regulation has been shown to be beneficial for mental health, and a growing body of studies has revealed that people who frequently adopt strategies to intensify and prolong positive experiences (that is, savoring ) show enhanced emotional well-being  and more sustained PE over time . For instance, a more extensive use of some strategies, such as counting blessings or sharing, leads to greater levels of happiness, despite experiencing few daily positive events . In another study, Langston et al.  found that capitalizing on positive events (i.e., the process of beneficially seizing and interpreting positive situations) further increases the experience of positive emotions. Furthermore, the intense use of strategies, such as mindfulness and positive reappraisal, has been found to predict higher levels of psychological well-being and enhanced experience of positive emotional states . In sum, there is a growing body of evidence that highlights the important emotional outcomes associated with the use of positive emotion regulation in daily life. However, not only can emotion regulation influence emotional outcomes, but emotions can also determine subsequent emotion regulation processes . This hypothesis is further confirmed by the evidence showing that momentary mood predicts subsequent affect levels , which suggests that emotion regulation might be partly determined by an individual's momentary emotional state . Nonetheless, the previous literature has been inconsistent about the association between PE and positive emotion regulation. On the one hand, the broaden-and-build theory states that the experience of PE enhances one's attentional scope and thought-action repertoire, leading to cognitive and behavioural broadening mechanisms  such as increased creativity or cognitive flexibility . These mechanisms have been hypothesized to affect emotion regulation processes as well. Thus, positive emotions are likely to encourage the adoption of adaptive, broadminded strategies that further enhance positive states . Consistent with this theory, the momentary experience of high levels of PE has been found to predict greater subsequent adoption of adaptive strategies such as problem solving  and mindfulness . On the other hand, pro-hedonic theories, such as the hedonic flexibility principle, suggest that people are likely to implement behavioural strategies based on their momentary mood in order to minimize negative affect and maximize positive emotions . More specifically, the experience of low positive emotions is supposed to motivate actions and behaviours to enhance mood. Thus, individuals are likely to increase their attempts to upregulate PE when experiencing a low rather than high level of PE. Recent studies have demonstrated that, when experiencing bad moods, people are more likely to engage in mood-enhancing activities, such as doing sport, going out in nature or chatting with a friend, whereas useful but mood-decreasing activities are pursued when the current mood is already high . In another study, individuals were found to seek pleasant social relationships when feeling bad and prefer solitude or less pleasant social interactions when feeling good . In sum, despite the growing evidence highlighting the importance of PE in mental health, there are still many unanswered questions about the regulatory mechanisms underlying positive states. Although positive emotion regulation has received increasing attention in the past decade, the effects of its momentary use are still unexplored. More specifically, whereas the findings about the emotional outcomes of positive emotion regulation are quite consistent, the effect of momentary PE on subsequent strategy implementation is still largely unknown. Importantly, momentary PE not only reflect the experience of a pleasant state, but they also represent an important source of information that drives regulatory mechanisms. Thus, exploring the reciprocal influences between PE and positive emotion regulation is important in order to disentangle the factors determining past, present and future positive emotional experiences. The current study The aim of the current study was to explore the reciprocal interconnection between PE and positive emotion regulation in daily life. To do so, we asked 85 undergraduate students to use a two-week Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to report their momentary levels of PE and rate the adoption of positive strategies to regulate ongoing PE. Despite the evidence showing that people's repertoire of positive strategies is quite large , it would have been too demanding and time-consuming to assess a high quantity of items at each assessment. Accordingly, we decided to focus on a limited number of positive strategies and to exclude dampening ones (i.e., strategies that decrease the intensity of ongoing PE). The rational adopted for selecting the strategies was based on Quoidbach et al.'s theory (2015) of positive emotion regulation. While the effectiveness of situation selection and situation modification strategies to enhance PE has been found to be weak or even largely unknown and controversial, there is more consistent evidence that supports the value of attentional deployment, cognitive change and response modulation strategies to increase positive emotions, especially in the short-term . We therefore decided to focus on these three categories and, for each of them, two strategies were selected based on the previous literature relating positive emotion regulation to PE, thus making a total of 6 strategies: mindfulness, stimulus control, broadening, counting blessings, emotion expression, and sharing. The use of this rational allowed us to explore the association between PE and positive emotion regulation both at a strategy and category levels. Attentional deployment refers to the set of strategies specifically designed to direct one's attention in order to savour a pleasant emotional state, which in turn increases the experience of positive states both in the short and long terms . In the present study, we explored the momentary use of mindfulness, which is focusing the attention on the present situation, and stimulus control, which refers to the attempt to avoid other negative thoughts in order to focus on the pleasant state. According to the previous literature, both strategies can play a role in daily positive emotional states. Indeed, a growing body of literature has found mindfulness to be associated with more intense and frequent positive emotions , which in turn has been shown to increase next-day mindfulness levels . Furthermore, Heiy and Cheavens  found stimulus control to be one of the most frequently adopted strategies in response to PE that positively affect general mood. Cognitive change refers to the attempt to influence the meaning of a positive stimulus, for example, by reappraising a positive situation as a special moment or by increasing the value attributed to a positive event. Generally, previous research has shown that reappraising a positive stimulus  and increasing the perceived value of a positive experience  are associated with enhanced levels of positive emotions. Indeed, not only does the adoption of cognitive change strategies enhance momentary positive emotional states, but it also has a modest impact on PE in the long-terms . In the present study, we assessed participants' use of broadening, which is thinking about the current pleasant state as part of a worthy life, and counting one's blessings, i.e., thinking about the special moments by not taking them for granted. Whereas one's perceived satisfaction and fulfilment in different aspects of life have been found to significantly affect emotional well-being ,    showed the significant effect of counting one's blessings on increasing positive emotions. Finally, response modulation includes strategies to influence the physiological, experiential or behavioural response to a positive state, which usually involve expressing the emotion with either verbal or nonverbal communication. Indeed, the accumulated literature coming from embodied cognition research has suggested that expressing positive emotions both physicallyfor example, by facial display )-and verbally  can boost the experience of the associated positive state. Consistently, we assessed the momentary use of emotion expression (i.e., the use of the body to express and communicate ongoing PE) as well as sharing (i.e., the tendency to share positive experiences through verbal communication with other people). The first objective of this study was to explore which of the two aforementioned theories better explains the association between PE and positive emotion regulation strategies. According to the broaden-and-build theory, the experience of intense PE fosters broadening mechanisms and the use of broad-minded positive strategies. In this case, and consistent with previous findings, high levels of PE should determine an increase in the subsequent use of positive strategies. In contrast, the hedonic flexible principle states that low mood, compared to high mood, predicts the implementation of strategies to enhance momentary emotions. Thus, a lower level of PE at a certain time should predict an increase in the use of positive emotion regulation from that time to the next. The second objective of this study was to explore the unique impact of six positive emotion regulation strategies on subsequent PE. Consistent with the ample evidence showing the beneficial emotional outcomes of positive regulation, we expected to find that increased use of positive strategies at one point predicted enhanced PE in the following assessment. The third objective was to investigate whether the reciprocal influence between PE and positive emotion regulation changes significantly depending on the intrinsic nature of strategies, as defined by the three categories explored in the present study: attentional deployment, cognitive change and response modulation. To this aim, we explored whether strategy category significantly moderated the association between positive emotion regulation and PE and, more specifically: (a) whether the strategy category moderated the impact of PE at t0 on positive regulation at t1, and (b) whether the strategy category moderated the effect of positive regulation on subsequent levels of PE. Material and methods Inclusion criteria and sample In order to exclude the potential confounding effect of depression, which has been shown to be associated with an impaired use of savoring strategies and an increased adoption of PLOS ONE dampening strategies , individuals with a score above 14 on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)  were excluded from the study (i.e., individuals with moderate to severe depressive conditions; n = 6). Similar to the sample size of previous EMA studies on emotion regulation , we recruited 85 undergraduate students at Jaume I University (Castellon, Spain). The sample was composed of 67 females (77.9%) and 19 males (22.1%); their ages ranged between 18 and 36 years (M: 22.07; SD: . This study was approved by the ethics committee of Jaume I University (certificate number: CD/57/2019), and informed consent was obtained from each participant. Material Participants were prompted three times a day for two weeks to complete a brief questionnaire on their smartphone, reaching a total of 42 potential observations for each participant. Consistent with previous studies, this sampling frequency has been shown to be adequate for the assessment of daily emotion regulation patterns  and it leads to good compliance levels . In the present study, 2726 out of 3570 possible assessments were obtained, thus revealing a mean compliance of 76.34% (SD = 18.12), ranging between 33% and 100%. At each prompt, participants were first asked to rate the momentary intensity of seven PE on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 (1 = not at all, 5 = a lot). The seven emotions were selected in order to include both low-arousal (hope, serenity, gratitude) and high-arousal (happiness, amusement, excitement, pride) positive emotions , which is consistent with the evidence showing the influence of positive regulation on both types of positive emotions . To obtain a general indicator of PE, the seven positive emotions rated at each assessment were averaged. The composite score obtained showed high internal consistency at both the between-(α = .96) and within-individual levels (α = .86). Participants were also asked to rate the momentary adoption of six positive strategies on a 0-100 scale (0 = no adoption, 100 = high adoption), which were selected with the aim of exploring three categories of positive regulation : mindfulness and stimulus control for the category 'attentional deployment'; broadening and counting blessings for the category 'cognitive change'; emotion expression and sharing for the category 'response modulation'. Due to the lack of validated questionnaires to assess positive strategies, ad hoc single items were created (see Table ), as is common in ecological studies exploring emotion regulation [see, for example, . These items were mostly inspired by a previous study . Similar to previous EMA studies exploring the reciprocal influences between emotion and emotion regulation [see for example , change scores were calculated for each strategy, indicating whether a strategy was used more or less at a certain time (t1), compared to the previous assessment (t0). These scores were calculated to analyse to what extent PE at t0 influenced positive emotion regulation change from t0 to t1. To compute change scores that are not affected by the so-called 'regression toward the mean effect', change scores were computed through linear mixed-effects models with maximum likelihood by taking the residuals of a model in which the strategy at t1 was regressed on itself at t0. In addition, strategy type was also taken into account in the analyses to explore further the relationship between PE and positive regulation depending on the intrinsic nature of the strategies adopted. To do so, strategies were averaged based on their category. This made it possible to obtain three new variables that reflected the intensity of use of each category of strategy. To assess the internal consistency of the new variables, correlations for each pair of strategies were performed at the between-individual level (attentional deployment: r = .882, p < .001; cognitive change: r = .981, p < .001; response modulation: r = .936, p <. 001) and within-individual level (attentional deployment: r = .556, p < .001; cognitive change: r = .732, p < .001; response modulation: r = .630, p < .001). PLOS ONE Procedure Participants were recruited via social media and poster advertisements placed in different buildings at the university. Students willing to participate were invited to visit the laboratory to receive more details about the study design and sign the informed consent. The EMA phase lasted 14 days. Participants received three daily semi-random prompts (between 9:30-14:00, 14:00-18:30, and 18:30-23:00) to complete the momentary assessment through the data collection program Qualtrics. To prevent backfilling, participants were given sixty minutes to access the survey; after that period of time, the assessment was marked as missing. During the entire study, participants could contact a researcher on the team to resolve technical issues. At the end of the study, participants were invited to return to the laboratory for a debriefing session. Participants who replied to at least 65% of the total EMA assessments received a monetary remuneration of 10 euros. Statistical analyses The datasets of the analyses and the R code are contained in an open-access file available on the OSF website at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/TEUBR. The data analytic strategy followed three steps that are similar to the steps found in previous ecological momentary assessment studies on reciprocal influences between emotions and actions .  PLOS ONE In an initial data preparation step, all the variables of interest were person-mean-centred to enable the examination of within-individual processes. Then, to analyse the relationships between variables assessed at two consecutive time points (t0 and t1), data were lagged. This meant deleting assessments that were not directly preceded or followed by another completed assessment (n = 558). Consequently, each row of the data frame analysed contained participants' responses to two consecutive assessments (see the 'Data.csv' file at https://doi.org/10. 17605/OSF.IO/TEUBR). The first aim of the study was to examine the effect of the PE felt at a given time on the subsequent implementation of positive strategies. To this end, a series of linear mixed-effects models containing one random intercept per participant were estimated using maximum likelihood with the R lmerTest package . Linear mixed-effects models were computed to take into account the hierarchical nature of the data. In this step, six models were computed (i.e., one per strategy). The dependent variable entered in each model was the change in the strategy of interest from t0 to t1, whereas the main independent variable was PE at t0. Two other independent variables were also included to neutralize their possible confounding effects: the use of each strategy at t0 and PE at t1. PE at t1 was included as a control variable. Not controlling for PE at t1 could produce a biased estimation of the effect of PE at t0 on the subsequent implementation of emotion regulation strategies. As PE at t1 was related to PE at t0 and strategy changes from t0 to t1, it could represent a confounding variable when attempting to determine the specific relationship between PE at t0 and strategy changes from t0 to t1. Therefore, to ensure that the effect of PE at t0 on strategy changes from t0 to t1 was not actually explained by PE at t1's relationships with both variables, we controlled for PE at t1 The second aim of the study was to examine the effect of positive emotion regulation strategies on subsequent PE level. To this end, one linear mixed-effects model was computed that contained PE at t1 as the dependent variable and change in the use of each strategy from t0 to t1 as independent variables. PE at t0 was also included as a control variable to neutralize the so-called regression towards the mean effect. Taken together, the analyses conducted to explore the first and second objectives of this study made it possible to analyse similar phenomena to those analysed in previous studies on reciprocal influences between emotions and actions in everyday life without resorting to their semi-retrospective assessment of strategy use (i.e., the effect of emotions at one time on the actions occurring between this time and a following time, and the effect of the actions performed within this time interval on concurrent emotional changes [e.g., ). The third aim of the study was to explore whether the relationships between PE and positive emotion regulation significantly changed depending on strategy category. To this end, the dataset on which our analyses were based was restructured to obtain a data frame where each row contained a participant's responses to two consecutive assessments for one strategy category. In this restructured data frame, each pair of consecutive assessments completed consisted of three rows (one for the intensity of the use of attentional deployment strategies, one for the intensity of the use of cognitive change strategies and one for the intensity of the use of response modulation strategies; see the 'Data_ST.csv' file at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/ TEUBR). Then, the two types of linear mixed-effects models mentioned for the first and second aims of the study were computed again, but with slight modifications. A first model was designed to examine whether the effect of PE at t0 on the change in strategy use depended on the category of the strategy considered. The dependent variable was change in strategy use from t0 to t1, whereas the independent variables were PE at t0 and the interaction with the strategy category (i.e., a categorical variable with three modalities: attentional deployment, cognitive change, response modulation), with PE at t1 as a control variable. A second model was designed to examine the effects of change in strategy use on subsequent PE depending on the category of strategy considered. This model included PE at t1 as the dependent variable, whereas the independent variables were change in strategy intensity, its interaction with the strategy category, and PE at t0. Results The influence of experienced positive emotions on positive emotion regulation Descriptive statistics are shown in Table . They provide an initial general overview of the association between PE and positive emotion regulation. The first aim of the study was to explore the effects of PE on positive emotion regulation. In a series of linear mixed-effects models (Table ), we therefore examined how PE at t0 influenced changes in each of the strategies at t1, controlling for the use of each strategy at t0 and for PE at t1. Results showed that the effects were all negative and significant. In other words, the less individuals felt positive emotions at t0, the more they tended to enhance the use of mindfulness (b = -0.16, SE = 0.023, p < 0.001), stimulus control (b = -0.105, SE = 0.025, p < 0.001), broadening (b = -0.075, SE = 0.024, p < 0.01), counting blessings (b = -0.124, SE = 0.023, p < 0.001), emotion expression (b = -0.0647, SE = 0.025, p < 0.01), and sharing (b = -0.069, SE = 0.025, p < 0.01) from this time to the next. Therefore, our results seem to confirm the hypothesis postulated by the hedonic flexibility principle, suggesting that the experience of low PE is likely to motivate individuals to subsequently increase the use of positive strategies in order to upregulate positive emotional states. The influence of positive emotion regulation on experienced positive emotions The second aim of the study was to explore the emotional outcomes of positive emotion regulation. We hypothesized that strategy change at t0 would predict PE at t1 and, more specifically, that an increase in the use of positive strategies would be associated with a greater experience of PE in the subsequent assessment. Table . Results of the six linear mixed-effects models predicting change in strategy use from PE at t0.  Change in Mindfulness Change in Stimulus control Change in Broadening Change in Counting blessings Change in Emotion expression Change in PLOS ONE To test this hypothesis, a linear mixed-effects model was performed that included PE at t1 as the dependent variable (Table ). Confirming our hypothesis, all the strategies were found to predict PE positively at t1, and, thus, an increase in the use of positive strategies at one time enhanced the experience of PE in the subsequent assessment (mindfulness: b = 0.284, SE = 0.024, p < 0.001; stimulus control: b = 0.046, SE = 0.021, p < 0.05; broadening: b = 0.093, SE = 0.026, p < 0.001; counting blessings: b = 0.125, SE = 0.025, p < 0.001; emotion expression: b = 0.192, SE = 0.022, p < 0.001; sharing: b = 0.093, SE = 0.022, p < 0.001), controlling for PE at t0 (b = 0.21, SE = 0.016, p < .001). The moderating role of strategy category Finally, we explored whether the association between PE and positive emotion regulation significantly changed depending on the strategy category. A first linear mixed-effects model investigated whether the strategy category affected the impact of PE at t0 on strategy use at t1 (Table ). However, no significant interactions were observed. We then examined whether the strategy category influenced the effect of change in strategy use on subsequent levels of PE (Table ). Interestingly, results revealed that the strategy category moderated the association between the change in strategy use and PE. More specifically, there was a significant interaction between change in strategy use and response modulation (b = -0.161, SE = .027, p <. 001) and a close-to-significant trend in the interaction between change in strategy intensity and cognitive change (b = -0.054, SE = .027, p = .059). As Fig  shows, the use of response modulation strategies to enhance PE was significantly less effective than the adoption of attentional deployment strategies. Discussion To date, although the use of strategies to regulate negative emotions has been extensively explored, the regulation of positive emotional states in everyday life has received little attention. The aim of the current study was to deepen our knowledge about PE and its underlying regulatory mechanisms. Overall, we showed that PE determines positive emotion regulation, which in turn affects subsequent levels of PE, thus confirming the existence of a reciprocal influence between momentary PE and positive emotion regulation.  PLOS ONE The first aim of the study was to explore the effects of PE on positive emotion regulation. The results showed that PE at t0 significantly predicted positive emotion regulation at t1 and, more specifically, that the less individuals felt PE at one time (t0), the more they tended to increase the use of positive strategies from this point to the next (from t0 to t1). Experiencing low levels of PE is, therefore, likely to shift one's efforts towards implementing strategies to reach a more positive emotional state. These findings are consistent with the hedonic flexibility principle , suggesting that individuals are likely to be motivated to upregulate PE as a consequence of low momentary affect. This regulatory mechanism might be seen as a highly adaptive process that can compensate for the lack of PE through an increased use of positive strategies, regardless of their nature (i.e., attentional, cognitive or behavioural). Moreover, the findings of the present study might also be understood in light of the affective baseline theory , which postulates the existence of a baseline functioning of an individual's affective system. According to this theory, although fluctuations around the home-base are the natural consequence of internal and external life events, affect is constantly brought back to the baseline by an attractive component consisting of regulatory mechanisms. Thus, the experience of low PE might encourage individuals to implement  PLOS ONE strategies that induce a return to the baseline, which has been shown to be defined by a slightly positive valence . In spite of being coherent with the hedonic theories, our results diverge from previous studies that showed increased implementation of positive strategies as a consequence of high levels of positive emotions . A possible explanation for these divergent results might be found in the EMA design. All the previous studies adopted a momentary evaluation of the emotional state but a retrospective assessment of emotion regulation, asking participants to rate the strategies used since the last prompt (i.e., in the previous few hours). Thus, when analysing the effect of emotions at one point on subsequent strategy use, emotion regulation strategies were closer in time to the emotions than in our study, which assessed emotion regulation at exactly the same time as PE. In fact, there is evidence showing that soon after an emotion, mood-congruent processes take place, whereas mood-incongruent processes tend to follow . Furthermore, the two theories suggested by the previous literature could be reconciled. The broaden-and-build theory states that the experience of PE encourages the building of adaptive resources and boosts the creation of coping skills, which in turn foster well-being. Accordingly, this 'resource-building process' might involve mechanisms that help to enhance affect when experiencing low PE and maintain a positive mood (i.e., consistent with hedonic theories), which in turn would promote psychological well-being and resilience in the long term. The second aim of the study was to explore the unique emotional outcomes of positive emotion regulation. Confirming our hypothesis, an increase in the use of all six strategies resulted in enhanced PE in the subsequent assessment. In previous studies, trait savoring was found to be associated with greater happiness and well-being , whereas state savoring was shown to predict increased positive emotions . Therefore, these results are consistent with the previous literature and support the adaptive role of positive emotion regulation in emotional well-being. Finally, our third aim was to investigate whether the reciprocal influence between PE and positive emotion regulation changed significantly depending on the intrinsic nature of the strategies. The results showed that the strategy category significantly moderated the association between the change in strategy use and subsequent PE. More specifically, the use of response modulation strategies (e.g., sharing and emotional expression) was significantly less effective than the adoption of attentional deployment strategies and produced a less important increase in subsequent PE. Sharing positive experiences has been shown to improve one's perception in the eyes of others, leading to increased self-esteem  and life satisfaction . This strategy might, therefore, indirectly increase PE by mainly targeting other dimensions of an  PLOS ONE individual's well-being. Furthermore, the benefits of sharing have been shown to depend on how the recipient responds to the news (actively/constructively or passively/destructively) , which could further justify the mitigated effects of this strategy on momentary PE found in our study. In contrast, emotional expression refers to the verbal or nonverbal expression of an ongoing emotion , which makes it possible to rapidly and adaptively react to environmental threats and opportunities . Emotional expression may foster PE, especially in the short term (i.e., soon after the emotion is produced), thus showing reduced effects in the long term. As suggested in a previous study , positive emotion regulation might not only increase only PE. Instead, each strategy may target different dimensions of the person's emotional well-being, thus involving different emotional outcomes. However, further studies are needed to disentangle the unique emotional consequences of positive emotion regulation. Although this study sheds new light on the mechanisms underlying the experience of PE, we acknowledge several limitations that could be addressed by future research. First, our study involved a sample of 85 healthy undergraduate individuals. Future studies are needed to explore the reciprocal influence between PE and positive emotion regulation in a more diverse sample. Second, we excluded participants who presented moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. It is possible that the patterns observed in the present study cannot be extended to samples of patients suffering from an emotional disorder , who are typically prone to dampening rather than savoring PE . Reasonably, an abnormal functioning of this mechanism might be observed in this population, which could be defined by a lack of motivation or capacity to implement positive strategies despite experiencing low PE, or by reduced efficacy in using positive strategies to increase PE levels. Future studies should confirm this hypothesis. Third, our study specifically focused on PE, without studying the role of negative affect on positive emotion regulation. A growing body of evidence shows that positive and negative affect do not lie on opposite ends of a bipolar scale; instead, they can be experienced simultaneously . In our study, we found that the experience of low PE was associated with a greater use of positive strategies, which might suggest that upregulating PE also serves as a mechanism to repair mood . Nevertheless, the absence of a variable assessing momentary negative emotions keeps us from confirming this hypothesis, which should be addressed in future studies. Fourth, the daily EMA included the assessment of only six positive strategies. On the one hand, there is evidence that people's repertoire for dealing with PE includes a wider range of strategies that were not explored in this study . On the other hand, the use of maladaptive strategies in response to positive states (e.g., dampening) was not taken into consideration, thus limiting the findings of the present study to the mechanisms underlying the upregulation of PE. Finally, the use of ad hoc single items to assess a multifaceted construct such as emotion regulation might not fully capture the complexity of this process. In addition to the fact that the use of ad hoc items is common in EMA studies [see for example, , the validated questionnaires available to assess positive emotion regulation mainly measure an individual's tendency to savour positive emotions (see for example ), rather than measuring to what extent specific strategies are adopted in response to a specific stimulus (e.g., state emotion regulation). The lack of validated measures for the assessment of momentary positive regulation led us to create our own single items. Moreover, there is evidence that long EMA questionnaires usually lead to higher perceived burden , which further supports the decision to include only a few items to assess emotion regulation. Indeed, the inclusion of a broader set of items could have resulted in decreased compliance and increased participant burden, thus affecting the quality of the data collected. As Trull and Ebner-Premier  recently stated, EMA is still a field with several methodological aspects that remain unclear. Accordingly, there is the need to expand and improve this research field further by, for instance, creating validated measures to be used in EMA designs or developing rigorous guidelines that guides researchers in the design of EMA studies. Despite these limitations, our research adds to the previous literature by extending our knowledge about PE and the underlying regulatory mechanisms. More specifically, we showed that low levels of PE determine an increase in the use of strategies to upregulate PE, which in turn results in a better mood. Although further studies are needed to confirm these findings, our study sheds new light on the importance of PE for emotional well-being, and it opens up new avenues to understand the dysfunctional regulation of positive emotional states in emotional disorders.

30,30,Self-Critical and Self-Punishment Cognitions Differentiate Those With and Without a History of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury: An Ecological Momentary Assessment Study,"The aim of this study was to examine trait, state, and temporal instability measures of self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions to evaluate their respective roles in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Participants were university students with a history of NSSI (n = 64) and those with no history of NSSI (n = 59). At baseline, participants completed measures assessing history of NSSI behavior, as well as trait measures of self-criticism and self-punishment. After com-pletion of baseline procedures, participants subsequently participated in a 10-day ecological momentary assessment protocol in which self-critical and self-punishment cognitions were assessed in real time three times daily. Employing bivariate and multivariate frameworks, our results demonstrate that both trait and state levels of self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions robustly differentiate between young adults with and without a lifetime history of NSSI. The present results also confirm that the temporal instability of these cognitive states also meaningfully differentiate between groups, such that those who exhibit greater fluctuations in these cognitive states are more likely to have a history of NSSI. The current findings suggest that trait, state, and temporal instability of negative self-focused cognitions may be vulnerability factors for engagement in NSSI.","[""nonsuicidal self-injury"", ""self-criticism"", ""self-punishment"", ""ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1016/j.beth.2020.08.006,"and includes self-cutting and burning behaviors. The onset of NSSI occurs typically in early-to mid-adolescence , with a pooled prevalence estimate of 17.2% among adolescents and 13.4% among young adults . Individuals with a history of NSSI are at risk for continued engagement; indeed, a history of NSSI is one of the strongest predictors of future NSSI (weighted OR = 5.95; . Furthermore, a history of NSSI is associated with psychological distress, and is a strong prospective predictor of suicidal behavior, as well as other negative mental health outcomes . Therefore, a growing body of research has focused on elucidating the underlying mechanisms for NSSI's onset and maintenance. Incorporating and extending such empirical work, numerous theories have emerged to aid in guiding future research on the etiology of NSSI. A particularly promising such theory, the Benefits and Barriers Model of NSSI , holds that ""(a) NSSI has the potential to provide a range of benefits for nearly everyone but that (b) most people do not access the benefits that result from NSSI because certain physiological, psychological, and social barriers disincline them from doing so."" A central barrier highlighted by this model is a positive view of the self, which is hypothesized to protect individuals from selecting NSSI as a regulatory behavior. Ample research supports this notion. People who engage in NSSI demonstrate lower levels of self-worth than individuals who do not engage in NSSI across several domains, including self-disgust , body image (e.g., , self-hate , selfdissatisfaction , selfesteem , and self-criticism (e.g., . In a thorough review of the relationship between NSSI and low self-worth, Forrester and colleagues found that individuals who engage in NSSI tend to report low self-esteem, and note that this effect is even stronger when considering hostile forms of selfevaluation, including self-criticism, self-disgust, and self-hatred. Moreover, experimental research has provided evidence that self-criticism is positively correlated with mood improvement during a pain induction task , and that a brief intervention aimed at reducing self-critical cognitions reduces willingness to enact self-directed pain . A central, and arguably complementary benefit highlighted by the Benefits and Barriers Model of NSSI is that ""NSSI gratifies self-punishment desires"" such that enacting NSSI provides cognitive reinforcement to those who possess the desire to self-punish . In addition to theory supporting this model (i.e., Defective Self Model of NSSI; , empirical evidence suggests that self-punishment is a commonly endorsed function of NSSI . Recent evidence has also suggested that within-person increases in self-punishment cognitions predict increases in NSSI thoughts and behaviors among self-injurers (e.g., . Further supporting this hypothesized benefit of NSSI, experimental evidence suggests that individuals who report engaging in NSSI as a form of self-punishment experience greater emotional reinforcement from a laboratory pain task than those who endorse alternative functions of NSSI . Despite growing evidence supporting the role of self-criticism and self-punishment cognitions in the onset and maintenance of NSSI, several questions remain. First, the vast majority of the literature on the relationship between self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions and NSSI has relied mainly on trait measures that can fall prey to recall bias and do not capture fluctuations in these cognitions over time. No studies to our knowledge have examined both trait and ecologically valid state (real-time) measures of self-critical and self-punishment cognitions to attain a more fine-grained understanding of their respective roles in differentiating those with and without a history of NSSI. Second, prior research has suggested that affective instability may be uniquely associated with NSSI, suggesting that NSSI may be used as a means to stabilize aversive affective states . A growing body of empirical and ecologically valid evidence supports the relevance of affective instability in NSSI , which is in line with evidence suggesting that trait measures of emotional dysregulation are predictive of NSSI . However, no studies have examined the instability of self-critical and self-punitive cognitive states to determine whether instability of these cognitions also is meaningful in differentiating those with and without a history of NSSI. If instability in these cognitive states is associated with a history of NSSI, results would provide preliminary evidence that dysregulation in aversive cognitive states, in addition to emotional states, may be associated with NSSI risk. In order to fill these gaps in the literature, the current study employed an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) design to attain state ratings of self-critical and self-punishment cognitions. This methodology allows for the attainment of more ecologically valid trait ratings and permits the estimation of within-individual variation . The current study aimed to examine and determine the contribution of trait and state ratings of self-critical and self-punishment cognitions in differentiating young adults with and without a history of NSSI. We endeavored to examine these aims in a bivariate framework, as well as a multivariate framework to estimate individuals' within-and between-factor levels on the variables of interest, adjusting for measurement error. A secondary aim of this study was to examine whether within-person temporal instability in these cognitive states also may contribute to group classification. Finally, an exploratory aim of the current study was to examine the relative strength of associations between state versus trait selfcritical and self-punishment cognitions and group classification. We hypothesized that trait and state self-critical and self-punishment cognitions would be strongly associated with a history of NSSI. We additionally hypothesized that within-person temporal instability in these cognitive states would be associated with group membership, such that greater fluctuations in self-critical and self-punishment cognitions would differentiate those with and without a history of NSSI. Method participants The current study included 123 young adults, ages 18-26 (M = 19.85, SD = 1.75) from a diverse university setting. During recruitment, participants were selected for two groups: participants with a lifetime history of NSSI (i.e., a minimum of two prior acts; n = 64) and participants with no history of NSSI (i.e., no prior acts; n = 59). Group status was selected based on an initial self-report questionnaire  and confirmed by a clinician-rated interview . Inclusion criteria also were a lack of impaired vision and fluency in English. Participants were not excluded based on demographic characteristics. The majority of the full sample identified as female (87.8%). The full sample was racially diverse with 62.6% White, 15.4% Asian, 9.0% Black, 5.7% biracial, 8.1% other race, and 0.8% indicated that they preferred not to answer. Additionally, 10.6% of the sample identified their ethnicity as Hispanic. A variety of sexual orientations were represented, with the majority of participants identifying as heterosexual (74.8%), 17.1% as bisexual, 1.6% as homosexual, and 6.6% as other or prefer not to answer. This study was approved by the university Institutional Review Board. procedure University students were recruited to participate through the online research system, Sona Systems, and through posters and class announcements. All participants completed an electronic consent form and an initial self-report questionnaire, the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI; . The DSHI was used to assess initial eligibility per the inclusion criteria. Participants also reported on trait levels of self-criticism and self-punishment cognitions in the online screener. Participants were compensated for completing the screener with course credit. Those who were eligible for either group were invited subsequently to complete an inperson session as well as a 10-day EMA protocol following the in-person session. Part 1 Participants completed a written consent at the baseline in-person visit. To confirm their eligibility for each study group and to ascertain lifetime NSSI history, the clinician-rated Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI;  was administered. Part 2 Participants were trained on the EMA procedures and, with assistance from the research team, completed a sample signal-contingent EMA questionnaire to ensure that they understood all questions and response options. Starting 1 day after the baseline in-person visit, participants received links to four online surveys via preprogrammed text messages (using Google Boomerang services) each day for the 10-day observation period. The surveys were administered via Qualtrics. One of the four daily surveys served as a sleep diary, assessing only participants' prior night's sleep; these data were not analyzed in the current study. The other three daily surveys were identical 25-item signal-contingent questionnaires that were distributed within a self-chosen 12-hour period (e.g., 10 a.m.-10 p.m.). We allowed participants to choose this 12-hour block given that university student schedules are highly variable, and we endeavored to send alerts at times when the participants would be most likely to be available. Per the randomization protocol, the participants received one alert in the morning, afternoon, and evening 4-hour block. Participants were asked to complete the signalcontingent alerts as close to when they received them as possible and the minimum length of time between the alerts was programed to be 90 minutes. For participants in this sample, the signalcontingent questionnaires took an average of 2.8 minutes to complete. Participants were compensated for completing the EMA study protocol with course credit. To motivate protocol compliance, if participants completed at least 85% of the surveys within 30 minutes of receiving the alerts over the course of the 10-day EMA period, then they were offered an additional course credit or $15. We designed the study to maximize data without overburdening participants, particularly because incentives were minimal (mainly course credit). We were particularly concerned that too many alerts would lead to a low compliance rate, posing the threat of significant missing data. Therefore, we asked participants to complete a total of four surveys per day (three of which were signal contingent). The signal-contingent surveys were randomized given that prior evidence suggests that the assessed constructs fluctuate throughout the course of the day . Participants were informed that their responses were not monitored by the research team during the study. To ensure participant safety during the EMA period of the study, participants were provided with numbers to the national suicide hotline and 24-hour crisis intervention services in the city in which this study took place at the top of each page throughout the online questionnaires. Additionally, comprehensive referral and crisis information were provided at the completion of each signal-contingent alert. All participants were provided with verbal and written information about the purpose of the study and potential benefits that could emerge from study findings as part of our debriefing process. Regardless of EMA responses, all participants additionally were provided with a written list of mental health and crisis resources at this time. measures Screener The DSHI  assesses the frequency and duration of 17 types of NSSI behaviors the participant may have engaged in, such as cutting, carving, burning, biting, and head banging. The DSHI assesses which types of NSSI behavior the participant has engaged in with the prompt, ""Have you ever intentionally (i.e., on purpose) _______?"" For each NSSI behavior endorsed, the measure inquires about the age at onset, frequency, recency, length of engagement in years, and whether hospitalization or medical treatment was required as a result of the behavior. Prior evidence has supported the psychometrics of the DSHI in a university-student sample, including the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct, discriminant, and convergent validity of the measure . The DSHI was used during the screener to initially assess the presence or absence of a lifetime history of NSSI behavior, which was a key inclusion criterion for being invited to the in-person assessment. Part 1: In-Person Assessment Lifetime history of NSSI. The SITBI  is a structured interview that assesses current and past history of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs), with additional questions to measure the frequency and characteristics of endorsed experiences. The SITBI assesses age of onset and frequency of NSSI, suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide gestures, and suicide attempts across several time frames, including in the prior month. Strong evidence supports the psychometric properties of this interview, which has been used in various clinical and nonclinical settings, including interrater reliability, construct validity, and testretest reliability . The reliability of the SITBI was determined by agreement between joint ratings in 20% of the interviews. These calculations found 100% agreement between the raters when assessing NSSI history in the current study. Eligibility in each of the two respective study groups was initially determined with the screener DSHI questionnaire and confirmed with the SITBI. Trait self-critical cognitions. Self-critical beliefs were assessed with the Self-Rating Scale (SRS; . This measure includes eight items, including ""If others criticize me, they must be right"" and ""I often feel inferior to others."" Items were assessed on a Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). High scores on the SRS indicate greater levels of selfcritical cognitions. Prior research has demonstrated good psychometric properties for the SRS . Previously it also has been found to successfully distinguish between self-injurers and healthy controls . Internal consistency of total scores on the SRS was α = .93. In the current analyses, trait level of self-critical cognitions was included as an independent variable. Trait self-punishment cognitions. In the current study, one item was added to the SRS to measure self-punishment cognitions: ""I am deserving of pain and punishment."" Like all items on the validated SRS, this item was assessed on a Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). This item was administered as part of the SRS, although it is examined separately. In the current analyses, trait level of self-punishment cognitions was included as an independent variable. Part 2: Ecological Momentary Assessment State self-critical and self-punishment cognitions. Three times per day, the EMA survey asked participants to report state levels of selfcritical and self-punishment cognitions with one item each. These items included ""Right now, to what extent are you feeling self-critical?"" and ""Right now, to what extent are you feeling deserving of pain and punishment?"" Each item was rated on a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 9 (very much). Higher scores indicated greater levels of state self-critical and self-punishment cognitions at the present moment. In the current study, we calculated aggregate state scores by taking the average of all self-critical and self-punishment cognition scores across all signal-contingent assessments. analytic strategy To examine differences in trait self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions between groups, we first employed invariance testing to examine whether the trait self-criticism measure (SRS; validated original eight-item measure) was comparable across comparison groups. For factorial invariance estimation analyses, the SRS items were treated as ordered categorical, given that the responses were integer values on a Likert scale; a weighted least squares estimator was utilized. To examine differences in state self-critical and self-punishment cognitions between groups free from measurement error, we used multilevel confirmatory factor analysis on the state self-critical and selfpunishment cognition items to attain factor scores that partition both within and between participant variance. For multilevel factor analyses, self-critical and self-punishment cognition items were treated as continuous, and a maximum likelihood estimator with robust standard errors was employed. Of note, we also examined differences in trait and state selfcritical and self-punishment cognitions between groups utilizing the raw scores of both the trait and aggregated mean self-critical and selfpunishment cognition scores. Invariance Testing First, we examined the extent to which the SRS scale was comparable across our comparison groups. To do so, we examined the factorial invariance of a single-factor SRS model across participants who reported engaging in NSSI (NSSI +) and those who did not (NSSI-). We examined three levels of measurement invariance, where each level is established sequentially . Each level requires placing equality constraints on model parameters across groups, and examining changes in model fit as a result of equality constraints. Configural invariance is established when the latent SRS model shows the same patterns of indicator loadings across groups. To examine configural invariance, we evaluated the fit of a single-factor confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model in both the NSSI + and NSSI-groups. Metric invariance requires that indicator loadings be identical across groups. Strong invariance requires that indicator intercepts be identical across groups. Metric and strong invariance are examined in a single step, wherein factor loadings, as well as indicator thresholds, are simultaneously constrained to equality across groups, and model fit is compared with that of the configural model. Once factorial invariance was achieved, we parameterized a single-factor SRS model across the entire sample and saved the factor scores from this model to use in subsequent regression analyses. Multilevel Modeling We utilized multilevel CFA (MCFA;  for the concurrent examination of multiple indicators within a multilevel framework. This approach permits the partitioning of observed variables into latent between-and within-person portions. Further, it takes into account the nature of the nested (repeated observations per person across the 10 days of the study), multivariate (multiple ratings of self-criticism and self-punishment daily), and time-structured (individual observations are ordered in time) nature of the current data. Following the strategy outlined by Sadikaj et al., we parameterized separate single-factor selfcriticism and self-punishment models comprising individuals' three self-criticism and self-punishment ratings per day at both the within-and betweenperson levels. The within-person factors account for the shared variance among daily self-criticism and self-punishment ratings (i.e., day-level differences in self-criticism and self-punishment); the betweenperson factors account for the individual differences among mean criticism and punishment scores (i.e., individual-level differences in self-criticism and selfpunishment). Evaluation of model fit for MCFA models must be done in a level-specific manner, because evaluating the fit of the entire model can obscure localized areas of misfit at either the within-and between-person levels . To evaluate model fit at the between-person level, the within-person level was saturated (i.e., identified with 0 df; all correlations among indicators at the between-person level are estimated). To evaluate model fit at the within-person level, the between-person level was saturated (i.e., identified with 0 df; all correlations among indicators at the within-person level are estimated). The portion of the model that was saturated does not contribute to the ill fit of the model; consequently, the fit statistics can be used to evaluate level-specific model fit of the nonsaturated level. Between-person factor scores were then saved for subsequent use in regression analyses.  Of note, we also examined Aim 1 through employing a series of binary logistic regressions utilizing the raw scores of both the trait and aggregated mean self-critical and self-punishment cognition scores. Analyses were conducted in Mplus (Version 8;  for invariance testing and multilevel modeling, and in R using the stats package for regression analyses (Version 1.2.5019; R Core Team) and the Cocor package  for the correlation comparison analyses. Temporal Instability We used SPSS (Version 23.0) to examine the temporal instability of self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions by calculating timecorrected mean squared successive difference (MSSD), an index of instability that incorporates both the variability and temporal dependency of state measures . In the current study, the MSSD score reflects the average of squared differences between successive selfreported state self-critical and self-punishment cognition scores . Results Participants in the NSSI + group engaged in a mean of 54.34 lifetime NSSI acts (SD = 124.8, range = 2-720), employing an average of 1.97 methods (SD = 1.07, range = 1-6). Approximately 43.75% (n = 28) of participants reported engaging in NSSI over the past year, 20.3% (n = 13) over the past month, and 4.7% (n = 3) over the past week. A total of 73.4% (n = 47) endorsed cutting or carving skin, 26.6% (n = 17) scraping skin to the point of drawing blood, 25% (n = 16) hitting self on purpose, 18.8% (n = 12) burning skin, 6.3% (n = 4) inserting sharp objects into skin or nails, 18.8% (n = 12) picking areas of body to the point of drawing blood, 1.6% (n = 1) giving self a tattoo, 2 and 26.6% (n = 17) other. Participants across groups in the present study completed 3,269 signal-contingent alerts, such that participants completed an average of 88.93% of the three times daily alerts over the 10-day study period (M = 26.68, SD = 3.49). The NSSI + and NSSI-groups completed signal-contingent alerts at similar rates, t(121) = 1.40, p = .166, d = 0.25. For the purpose of the present study, only alerts that were completed within 60 minutes of the time at which the alert was sent were used in the present analyses to ensure alerts were temporally ordered (2,912 total signal-contingent alerts; 78.9% of the three times daily alerts). The NSSI + and NSSI-groups completed signal-contingent alerts within this 60-minute time frame at similar rates, t(121) = -.396, p = .639, d = 0.07. Table  depicts descriptive statistics for the EMA measures of self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions. Significant correlations were found between trait and state self-critical cognitions measures (r = .538, p < .001) and between trait and state self-punishment cognitions measures (r = .581, p < .001). do trait and aggregated state levels of selfcritical and self-punishment cognitions differ between young adults with and without a history of nssi? SRS Factorial Invariance Configural invariance. Due to a relative lack of endorsement of the highest values for Item 3 on the SRS (see  in the NSSI- Note. M = mean; TC MSSD = time-corrected mean squared successive differences; NSSI = nonsuicidal self-injury; SC = self-critical cognitions; SP = self-punishment cognitions. group, we collapsed the top two response options across both the NSSI + and NSSI-groups before proceeding. The single-factor SRS model demonstrated adequate fit in both the NSSI + (CFI = .95, TLI = .93, RMSEA = .21) and NSSI-(CFI = .98, TLI = .98, RMSEA = .14) groups when estimated in separate models. Similarly, when estimated in a multigroup analysis-wherein separate CFA models are parameterized in both the NSSI + and NSSI-groups simultaneously-the configural model demonstrated excellent fit to these data (CFI = .98, TLI = .96, RMSEA = .05). Factor loadings for configural models are presented in Supplementary Table . Metric and strong invariance. Constraining factor loadings and thresholds to equality across groups resulted in a similarly well-fitting model (CFI = .97, TLI = .97, RMSEA = .05) when compared with the configural modal, with additional parsimony. Group mean differences. Given that strong invariance was achieved across groups, we then examined differences in self-critical cognitions factor means between groups. To do so, we parameterized the single-factor model across both groups. We constrained the factor mean to 0 in the NSSI-group, and we allowed the factor mean in the NSSI + group to be freely estimated. Therefore, the factor mean in the NSSI + group represents the difference-in standard deviation units-of the mean factor level in the NSSI + group when compared with that of the NSSI-group. Similar to the results found using scale scores, individuals who engaged in NSSI were significantly higher on the SRS than those who did not (M = 0.67, p < .001). Self-Critical Cognition Multilevel Confirmatory Factor Analysis Model Self-Punishment Cognition Multilevel Confirmatory Factor Analysis Model SRS factor model across groups. Inasmuch as we found evidence for factorial invariance, we parameterized a single-factor SRS model across both the NSSI + and NSSI-groups, with all item indicators in their original metric (i.e., we did not collapse the highest response options to Item 3 in these analyses). This single-factor model demonstrated good fit to these data (CFI = .95, TLI = .94, RMSEA = .07). Factor loadings are presented in Supplementary Table . Multilevel Analyses Self-criticism. The single-factor self-criticism model fit the data well (CFI/TLI > .99, RMSEA < .001). In addition, when individual-level fit was examined, the model demonstrated excellent fit at both the within-(CFI/TLI > .99, RMSEA < .001) and between-(CFI/TLI > .99, RMSEA < .001) factor levels. Standardized factor loadings are presented in Figure . Self-punishment. The single-factor selfpunishment model fit the data well (CFI/TLI > .99, RMSEA < .001). In addition, when individual-level fit was examined, the model demonstrated excellent fit at both the within-(CFI/TLI > .99, RMSEA < .001) and between-(CFI/TLI > .99, RMSEA < .001) factor levels. Standardized factor loadings are presented in Figure . Group Classification Analyses A binary logistic regression demonstrated that the SRS factor score significantly predicted group status (log OR = 0.93, SE = 0.23, z = 4.11, p < .001). Similarly, the MCFA self-critical and the self-punishment between-individual factor scores were associated significantly with group status (see Table ). Providing evidence of the stability of these findings, univariate binary logistic regressions were run with the raw SRS total score, self-punishment cognitions trait item, and state self-critical and self-punishment cognitions aggregated means, and all were significantly, positively related to group status (see Table ). To examine our exploratory aim, to ascertain the relative strength of the relationships between raw trait and state self-critical cognitions and group status, and between raw trait and state selfpunishment cognitions and group status, we examined whether the correlation relationships were significantly different from one another. We found that there was no significant difference in the strength of relationships between raw trait and state self-critical cognitions and group status (Zou's CI ). However, we found that there was a significant difference observed in selfpunishment cognitions, such that although both trait and state self-punishment cognitions were significantly correlated with group status, trait self-punishment cognitions had a significantly stronger relationship with group status (Zou's CI [-0.31, -0.01]). Temporal Instability of Self-Critical and Self-Punishment Cognitions Time-corrected MSSD was calculated for selfcritical and self-punishment cognitions for both groups. Table  depicts the raw MSSD scores. Findings demonstrate that self-critical and selfpunishment MSSD scores were associated significantly with group status (see Table ), such that significantly greater fluctuations in self-critical and self-punishment cognitions were associated with NSSI + group membership. Discussion Our findings provide evidence supporting the Benefits and Barriers Model of NSSI. Employing bivariate and multivariate frameworks, our results demonstrate that both trait and state levels of selfcritical and self-punishment cognitions robustly differentiate between young adults with and  without a lifetime history of NSSI. The present results also confirm that the temporal instability of these cognitive states also differentiates meaningfully between groups, such that those who exhibit greater fluctuations in these cognitive states are more likely to have a history of NSSI. The first aim of this study was to assess whether trait and state levels of self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions differ between young adults with and without a history of NSSI. We found that higher levels of trait self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions, as well as greater aggregated raw mean state levels of self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions were associated with a history of NSSI. Our findings were confirmed through the employment of MCFA. Employing MCFA permitted us to partition error variance from our repeated measures of self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions and estimate latent between-and within-person portions while taking into account the nature of the nested, multivariate, and time-structured nature of the current data. Our results indicate that individuals with a history of engagement in NSSI showed that they not only portray themselves as more self-critical and deserving of pain and punishment on measures asking them to provide a static characterization of themselves, but also that they experience these cognitions to a greater degree in real time. Correlations between trait and state measures of self-critical cognitions were strong; similarly, correlations between trait and state self-punishment cognitions were strong. These correlations suggest that our trait and state measures share significant variance. However, the exploratory aim of this study was to examine the relative strength of relationships between trait and state self-critical and self-punishment cognitions and NSSI history (e.g., group status). Findings suggested that there was no significant difference in the strength of relationships between state and trait self-critical cognitions and NSSI history. However, results suggest that trait self-punishment cognitions were more strongly associated with NSSI history than state self-punishment cognitions. These findings suggest that trait and state self-critical cognitions, and trait and state self-punishment cognitions, respectively share significant variance, and that trait levels of self-punishment cognitions may capture variance beyond that of state levels. Even though trait self-punishment cognition measures in this study appear to offer superior incremental validity in terms of classification of groups, it is not clear whether this would be the case when evaluating the prediction of proximal risk for NSSI; future research is needed in this area. Our findings demonstrate that NSSI + participants not only experience more severe self-critical and self-punishment momentary cognitions but also that they experience greater fluctuations in these cognitive experiences than their non-selfinjuring counterparts. Our confidence in this finding is strengthened given our employment of a statistic of temporal stability that takes into account both the variability and the temporal dependency of these state measures. As previously outlined, evidence of affective temporal instability has been found in those with a history of NSSI (e.g., . The current study extends this body of research suggesting that those with a history of NSSI also experience heightened temporal instability in their experience of self-critical and self-punitive negative self-focused cognitions. It is possible that the rapid fluctuation of these cognitive states may contribute to the aversive internal states that typically precede episodes of NSSI, inasmuch as NSSI may be used to stabilize these cognitions; future research should explore this hypothesis. Future EMA research also should investigate the extent to which these cognitive states are regulated through engagement in NSSI, which may provide greater ecologically valid evidence for the Benefits and Barriers Model of NSSI  and the Defective Self Model of NSSI . The emotional cascade model of NSSI  suggests that ""cascades"" of ruminative thinking (i.e., perseverative thinking about one's feelings and problems) and negative emotions lead to the distressing internal states that NSSI serves to regulate. Ecologically valid research supports this model, suggesting that instability in ruminative thinking and negative emotionality interact to predict NSSI engagement . Future research should examine the extent to which self-critical and self-punitive cognitions may be the content of such ruminative thinking. Future research should also investigate the temporal relations between affective and negative self-focused cognitive states in those with a history of NSSI to determine whether the instability in these cognitive states may be considered a downstream or upstream effect of affective dysregulation, as the real-time direction of the observed effects may inform treatment development. clinical implications Identifying indices of cognitive vulnerability associated with NSSI history may serve to enhance our risk models and identify target mechanisms for timely and sensitive intervention. Cognitivebehavioral intervention approaches emphasize the identification and modification of maladaptive cognitions and have proven effective for treating and preventing a range of psychiatric problems, such as self-harm in adults (see , for a review). Despite advances in the efficacy of interventions targeting self-harm behaviors, few studies have directly tested mechanisms of change in the context of psychosocial interventions. Selfcritical and self-punishment cognitions may be important mechanisms to assess, both at the trait and state levels, to determine whether changes in these cognitions lead to reductions in NSSI behaviors over the course of treatment. In addition, studies are needed to examine the developmental trajectory of these cognitive processes, as it is also possible that self-critical and self-punishment cognitions serve as indicators of enhanced risk for the development of NSSI behaviors, informing preventive intervention development. strengths and limitations The current study has several important strengths that build upon prior research in this area. First, we examined both state-and trait-level cognitions, employing ecologically valid methods to capture self-critical and self-punishment cognitions in real time. Although studies have largely relied on traitlevel measures of these cognitions, few have utilized ecologically valid designs that offer several advantages to conventional self-report measures (i.e., reduced recall bias, sensitivity to the dynamics of cognitive processes, temporally delineated assessments). We also examined self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions in young adults both with and without a history of engaging in NSSI. To date, studies employing ecologically valid designs largely have examined mechanisms of risk in samples of individuals with NSSI histories, and relatively fewer also have included a control group with no selfinjury history. Our findings are strengthened by high compliance rates with the EMA protocol across both groups, which support the feasibility of using this methodology in high-risk groups. The results are further strengthened by the use of invariance testing to ensure the validity of comparing the SRS across groups. Identical results across aggregated state-level cognitions and modeled with MCFA similarly increase our confidence in our results. The present study has some methodological limitations to consider. First, the inclusion criterion for the NSSI + group was a minimum of two lifetime NSSI acts-as a result, the NSSI + group may be considered heterogeneous in their severity and recency of NSSI. Future studies should consider replicating the current findings in a sample meeting criteria for NSSI disorder, a disorder included in the fifth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) as one for further study. Although recent evidence suggests that the proposed NSSI frequency threshold (engaging in NSSI on 5 + days within the past 12 months) for this disorder lacks validity, and future research is needed to inform a clinically meaningful cutoff , employing this higher threshold may reduce sample heterogeneity and increase generalizability to a clinical population. However, it is important to consider that those with any history of NSSI, let alone repetitive history, are at greater risk for future NSSI  and future suicidal behavior , suggesting that the NSSI + group examined in this study represents a relatively clinically high-risk sample. Second, although we employed an EMA design, we did not examine the prospective associations between self-critical and self-punishment cognitions and NSSI thoughts or behaviors in this paper. Examining prospective relations was beyond the scope of the present report, which focuses on evaluating differences in these trait and state cognitions in young adults with and without a lifetime history of NSSI. Third, whereas the SRS is a well-validated scale for the assessment of self-critical thoughts, a single item was employed to assess trait self-punishment. Additionally, the state self-critical and selfpunishment cognition assessment via EMA consisted of single-item prompts. Notably, it is common for EMA studies to use single-item measures (e.g.,  as the demands of completing surveys multiple times per day requires concise assessment batteries. Nevertheless, our design presents challenges for assessing the reliability and validity of the items used to capture momentary cognitions. Fourth, our single-item assessment of self-punishment cognitions conflates feeling deserving of pain and feeling deserving of punishment. We encourage future research to examine these constructs separately to ascertain their individual trait and state associations with NSSI urges, and to determine whether examining them as distinct constructs is justified. Further, the optimal assessment (e.g., content and number of items) of state-level self-critical and self-punishment cognitions remains to be determined. Studies utilizing EMA to validate effective methods for capturing state-level changes of these cognitions and assessing the context under which they occur are needed . Finally, it is possible that constructs associated with both self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions and NSSI (e.g., symptoms of depression) may underly their relationships, and future studies should investigate such constructs as potential mediators. Despite these challenges, EMA provides a unique opportunity to assess temporal features of cognitive and affective processes, that in conjunction with static methods may illuminate critical target mechanisms for the prevention of NSSI behaviors.

32,32,Substance use behaviors in the daily lives of U.S. college students reporting recent use: The varying roles of romantic relationships,"While the detrimental consequences of problematic substance use behaviors in early adulthood are well-documented, the interpersonal predictors of substance use in the naturalistic context of daily life are less known. Methods: Using ecological momentary assessments to capture moments of binge drinking, marijuana use, nicotine use, and prescription misuse in everyday life, this study explored the romantic relationship contexts (status, quality, partner presence) of substance use among young adults (aged 18-21) attending a university in the Midwestern U.S. Between 2017 and 2019, 296 participants, who had endorsed recent substance use at screening for a larger study on prescription misuse, completed four reports per day for approximately 28 days, resulting in over 23,000 reports for this investigation. Results: Relationship status, partner support, and partner presence in the moment were all associated with at least one type of substance use behavior. Generalized multilevel models indicated that partnered participants engaged in less marijuana use, nicotine use, and prescription misuse in daily life compared to single participants. Higher partner support predicted less binge drinking, yet also predicted higher nicotine use and prescription misuse. When with a romantic partner in daily life, partnered participants were more likely to engage in binge drinking and marijuana use, and less likely to misuse prescription drugs. Nicotine use was more likely when with a partner, but only if partner support was high. Conclusions: Findings highlight the intricate links between interpersonal contexts and substance behaviors and indicate supportive relationships are not universally protective against substance use among this population.","[""College students"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Health behaviors"", ""Relationship quality"", ""Romantic relationships"", ""Substance use"", ""United States"", ""Young adults""]",10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114021,"Introduction A major contributor to disease and mortality across the globe is the problematic use of substances such as alcohol, marijuana, nicotine, and prescription drugs, which collectively cause millions of deaths every year (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime [UNODC], 2018; World Health Organization [WHO], 2019). In many industrialized nations the overall use of such substances is highest among late adolescents and young adults (ages ranging approximately 18-25) (UNODC, 2019), with particularly high rates among those in university settings , putting young adult college students at increased risk of numerous associated health problems such as substance use disorders and premature death . For instance, in 2017 young adults reported use at rates of 85% for alcohol, 44% for marijuana, 27% for cigarettes, and 14% for prescription stimulant misuse . Addiction and other substance use disorders are also highest among this age group (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , 2019), with over 10% of young adults (aged 18 to 25) in the U.S. estimated to have an alcohol use disorder and over 7% with an illicit drug use disorder, compared to 5% and 3%, respectively, among the overall population . In light of elevated rates and dire consequences of problematic alcohol, marijuana, nicotine, and prescription drug use-combined with the substance-conducive environments of college and the critical developmental period of young adulthood that makes substance use particularly risky for later health and well-being-understanding the factors associated with college students' substance use in daily life remains a pressing public health concern. Critically, young adulthood is also a period of increased interest and involvement in romantic relationships, which are known to play important roles in health behaviors such as substance use . Drawing from a sample of college students in the United States at elevated risk of substance use, this study investigates the role of romantic relationship contexts in young adults' various substance use behaviors throughout their daily lives. Substance use in young adults and college students Despite recently documented modest decreases in binge drinking and tobacco use among young adults, the rates remain high in many industrialized nations . Marijuana is by far the most commonly used drug among young adults across the world, and rates of marijuana use have been increasing in most industrialized countries, including the U.S. (National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA], 2019; UNODC, 2019). In addition to the established risks of substance use disorders and premature death associated with the problematic use of alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco , two other forms of problematic substance use have been recognized as major public health concerns. First, in the wake of targeted, successful global marketing programs, the use of electronic cigarettes ('e-cigs'), which typically contain highly addictive nicotine but no tobacco, has risen dramatically, particularly among adolescents and young adults . In 2018, use was estimated to be over 40 million adults worldwide, with annual prevalence rates up to 27% among young adults, in contrast to the steadily decreasing rates of tobacco use . Second, the medicalization and pharmaceuticalization of society and health  have resulted in a steady rise of prescription medications dispensed to the public, thereby increasing access for misuse either by the intended patient or by someone else. Psychoactive prescription drugs, e.g., opioid pain relievers, stimulants, and anti-anxiety sedatives and tranquilizers, are particularly prone to abuse, with misuse rates estimated to be over 14% among young adults in the U.S. and up to 17% among youth in other countries . Notably, the rates of past-year prescription misuse in young adults are the highest among any other age group worldwide . Furthermore, prescription misuse serves as a leading cause of drug-related deaths among young adults in the U.S. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019) and is highly correlated with other substance use . Thus, problematic substance use among young adults is highly prevalent with high potential for harm. Elevated rates of overall substance use among young adults can be explained in part by sociocultural contexts. Following adolescence, the developmental period of young adulthood is characterized by increasing autonomy, identity exploration, and peer influence , and, while not all 18-24-year-olds attend college, a substantial portion experience the transition from adolescence to young adulthood in a college or university setting-about 40% in the U.S. , with the vast majority living away from parents (U.S. Department of Education, 2017). College attendance is typically accompanied by high expectations for academic achievement in addition to recreation and personal discovery. In response, college students may use a variety of substances to meet these expectations or to cope with numerous transitions and peer influence . Combined with decreased supervision and increased unstructured time , college settings can become particularly encouraging environments for substance use. Thus, the developmental context of young adulthood, when coupled with the social context of college life, may make the use of substances especially appealing. Young adults' romantic relationships and substance use In addition to elevated substance use among young adults, a defining feature of the young adult developmental period is the increasing importance of romantic partners in behaviors and decision-making . Indeed, scholars have long documented the powerful role that intimate relationships can play in potentially risky health behaviors like substance use . While previous findings have mostly been observed among married couples, some evidence suggests that any committed relationship reduces young adults' likelihood of using certain substances. College students who reported being in a romantic relationship during data collection reported less frequent alcohol use in the previous 30 days compared to single participants . Similarly, in a longitudinal study that retrospectively assessed young adults' post-high school substance use, those who were in dating relationships reported decreased heavy alcohol and marijuana use compared to those who were single . These two studies suggest that, among young adults, being in a committed romantic relationship is associated with less frequent heavy alcohol and marijuana use compared to being single. Conversely, tobacco (Brathwaite et al.) and cigarette  use were not associated with relationship status in these studies. Notably, these previous studies used retrospective reports, which could affect reporting, and they did not include e-cigarettes when assessing nicotine use, limiting applicability to the present day. In addition to e-cigarette use, prescription misuse has also not been widely explored within the context of romantic relationships. Given the established importance of romantic relationships in health behaviors and in young adults' decision-making, relationship status may be an essential element of understanding, and potentially mitigating, several types of currently prevalent substance use behaviors in young adult college students. Furthermore, studies assessing the relationship context of substance use behaviors in daily life (versus retrospectively) remain rare. The quality of such romantic relationships has also been linked to substance use behaviors . Low-quality relationships, such as those characterized by low levels of support, can be detrimental to well-being , and the long-term connections between relationship quality and health may be mediated by unhealthy behaviors undertaken as an emotional response to relationship discord . Such low-quality relationships can increase stress and subsequent coping via substances or can hinder substance use desistence ). Among married couples, higher relationship quality has been associated with lower prescription misuse among wives  and a lower likelihood of alcohol problems . In the longitudinal study of young adults, higher relationship quality was associated with decreased cigarette use (regardless of partner use) and decreased heavy drinking and marijuana use when the partner's use was none to moderate . For young adult men and women in romantic relationships, lower relationship quality predicted higher substance use problems . Overall, low-quality relationships may be contexts in which substance use is relatively high. Extending these findings from retrospective reports, instances of substance use in daily life may be higher among individuals in less supportive relationships. On a momentary level, individuals in romantic relationships could make substance use decisions based on the presence of their partner. Substance use is often a social behavior , and given the heightened influence of romantic partners in young adults' health behaviors, the presence of a partner may determine whether an individual chooses to use a substance in a given moment. Previous studies on substance use have investigated the role of a romantic partner's use ), yet do not assess the role of the romantic partner's presence in moments when substances are being used. A handful of studies have investigated whether an individual's overall substance use is congruent with a romantic partner's use , and a diary study of prescription misuse among 46 mixed-sex couples in which at least one partner reported recent prescription misuse indicated that women who reported being with their partner more frequently overall were less likely to engage in prescription misuse . These studies offer preliminary evidence that time spent with a partner may be related to substance use, yet little is known about whether being with a partner in a given moment makes substance use more or less likely for individuals who use substances. Preliminary evidence further indicates a potentially complex interplay between partner presence and substance use. Dyadic studies on couple substance use indicate that relationship quality and individuals' substance use are interrelated with the partners' use, such that relationship quality is higher among those who use substances with a partner (versus at different frequencies) . This suggests that any association between partner presence and substance use may depend on relationship quality. However, this has not been examined on a momentary level. If substance use is compensating for a low-quality relationship, the association between partner presence and substance use may be stronger for individuals in less supportive relationships. Alternatively, substance use could be a valued shared activity that promotes intimacy, and therefore the association could be stronger for those in more supportive relationships. The current study The purpose of the current study was to assess the roles of romantic relationship factors in college students' substance use behaviors in daily life, using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods and drawing from a U.S. sample likely to report substance use behaviors (due to recent prescription misuse; , optimizing the ability to capture substance use in daily life. The study expands previous research in three key ways. First, with EMA methods, reports are collected in real time and in participants' real-world environments, thus minimizing recall biases and maximizing ecological validity . Time-based EMA methods collect data at randomized times within specific time periods, and are therefore designed to capture a reasonably representative sample of participants' daily experiences. Combined with event-based assessments triggered by participants' substance use behavior or behavioral intentions, EMA methods are well-suited to assess moments of substance use and contextual factors surrounding such use . The current study used time-based assessments for all substances, as well as event-based assessments for prescription misuse. Importantly, the collection of repeated measures allows for assessing between-person individual differences across the reporting period as well as within-person momentary differences that can compare individual's moments of substance use versus moments of nonuse. This approach also offers unique insight into the moment-level roles of romantic relationships in health behaviors. Second, several types of substance use behaviors currently prevalent among young adult college students are assessed. In addition to binge drinking and marijuana use, we include e-cigarettes when assessing nicotine use; we also assess prescription misuse, which the study was specifically designed to capture. Third, the study design allows for documenting associations between relationships and substance use in three distinct ways: 1) by comparisons across relationship status, 2) as a function of partner support, and 3) by assessing within-person differences of real-time partner presence on a momentary basis and exploring moderating effects of partner support in this association. Accordingly, we tested the following research questions for four substance use behaviors: binge drinking, marijuana use, nicotine use, and prescription misuse. RQ1: Do partnered participants report less substance use in daily life compared to single participants? We expect partnered participants will report lower likelihoods of substance use . RQ2: For partnered participants, is partner support associated with substance use behaviors throughout daily life? We expect lower levels of support to be associated with higher substance use . RQ3: a) Does real-time partner presence predict substance use behaviors in the moment? b) If so, does partner support moderate these within-person associations? Given indirect and mixed results in previous work we offer no definite hypotheses for these exploratory questions. Additionally, substance use is associated with adverse family environments during childhood, such as with caregivers who were abusive or neglectful, or who used substances themselves (for reviews, see . Such adverse early experiences are also linked to negative relationship outcomes in young adulthood . The analyses, therefore, include a measure of childhood family adversity , which captures several of these experiences, as a control variable. Methods Data is drawn from the first assessment of an ongoing longitudinal study of college students' health and well-being . All procedures were approved by the associated Institutional Review Board. Participants attended two in-person lab visits with approximately 28-days of ecological momentary assessments (EMA) collected in between. The current study was preregistered before analyses (link: osf. io/aqwzs). Participants and procedures From Fall 2017 to Fall 2019, freshmen and sophomores aged 18-21 at a university in the Midwestern U.S. were continuously recruited via mass emails, flyers, and targeted ads on social media and student newsletters. A confidential phone screen procedure was used to determine recent (past 3 months) misuse of prescription pain medications, stimulants, tranquilizers, or sedatives (for details, see identical protocol from a different study, . During the first lab visit, participants completed informed consent procedures and questionnaires, received an iPod touch device, and completed training for the EMA portion of the study. Following the EMA reporting period, participants returned for a second lab visit, completed additional questionnaires, returned their device, and received payment up to USD$250 ($75 for visit 1, $55 for visit 2, and $120 for EMA completion, which includes a $36 bonus incentive for timely completion). All received a list of substance, relationship, and mental health resources. Data were then downloaded to secure servers. Of the 300 participants endorsing recent misuse, two did not return their device, a glitch prevented one's data from downloading, and another did not complete the family adversity measure, resulting in a final sample of 296. Of these, 205 (69.3%) were women and 96 (30.7%) were men. The majority identified as Caucasian/White (83.4%), with 7.1% identifying as multiple races, 5.8% identifying as Asian, and less than 3% identifying as American Indian or Alaskan Native, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or Other; 6.4% identified as Hispanic. The partnered sample consisted of 107 individuals in dating relationships (partner genders unknown). There were no statistically significant differences in proportions of gender (χ = 0.31, p = .602), race (based on all seven categories; χ 2 = 8.05, p = .235), or Hispanic identity (χ 2 = 4.16, p = .050) between partnered and single participants. EMA procedures were designed to capture several substance use behaviors, with an emphasis on prescription misuse. Participants completed the EMA reports via the iPod touch device and could complete new reports at any time. All other functionality of the devices (e.g., internet connectivity) were disabled; live-monitoring was not possible. During the EMA reporting period, the iPod touch device sent a notification four times daily, once at random within four time periods (morning, afternoon, evening, night) , indicating it was time to complete an EMA report. The EMA reports took less than min to complete on average, and included questions about participants' location, who they were with, substance use (alcohol, marijuana, nicotine), mood, and recent events. Additionally, to assess prescription misuse, a portion of each EMA report asked whether participants were about to use any of four types of prescription medication (pain medications, stimulants, tranquilizers, or sedatives) either without a prescription or in a way a doctor had not prescribed. If they indicated intention to misuse any drug, a notification was sent 15 min after the EMA report was submitted, and the participants were given access to the follow-up report. The follow-up report asked whether or not any misuse actually occurred, along with other questions not relevant to the current study. Follow-up reports took less than a minute to complete on average. To more fully capture prescription misuse in daily life, participants were also instructed to self-initiate an EMA report any time they intended to misuse a prescription medication . Thus, an EMA report could be completed at any time and there were no restrictions on the number of reports that could be submitted. The time-based and event-based reports were therefore identical (i.e., indistinguishable) in the data. This combined design resulted in 23,260 reports from which the current data are drawn. For more details about app development, completion rates, and sample demographic characteristics, see . Measures Relationship variables During the first lab visit, participants were asked whether they were currently in a romantic relationship (Yes/No). If yes, several aspects of that relationship were assessed. Relationship length was converted to months. Participants were also asked to choose which of six relationship types described theirs the best: married, engaged, dating exclusively, dating frequently but not exclusive, dating once in a while, or only having sex. The only option selected by any participant was dating relationship. Relationship quality was assessed by the Partner Support and Partner Strain scales for intimate partners . The four items for support, answered on a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = a lot; 4 = not at all) assessed how much their partner understands their feelings and cares about them, and how much they can rely on their partner for help and open up to them about worries. Items were reverse-scored so higher values indicated higher support. Reliability as gauged by Cronbach's α = .69. Partner Strain items exhibited less than adequate reliability (α = .55), indicating a weak measure for this sample, and were removed from analyses. During the EMA reports, participants indicated whether they were alone or with others; if with others, they indicated who they were with (roommate or friend, romantic partner, parents, other family, and/or other). If romantic partner was endorsed, partner presence was coded as 1; if alone or not with a partner, this was coded as 0. Substance use In the EMA reports, for each of the three non-prescription substances (alcohol, marijuana, nicotine) participants were asked about their use in the previous 15 min (Yes/No). If participants endorsed marijuana or nicotine use, their responses to these items were coded as 1; otherwise they were coded as 0. If participants endorsed nicotine use, they were asked what form (cigarette, chewing tobacco, and/or e-cigarette). If alcohol was endorsed, participants were asked the number of drinks they had consumed. If women reported 4 or more drinks and if men reported 5 or more drinks (occasion-based definition; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2019), binge drinking was coded as 1; otherwise, it was coded as 0. In the follow-up reports, if any misuse behavior was endorsed, misuse was coded as 1; if misuse was not endorsed or a follow-up was not sent, misuse was coded as 0. Given our goal of assessing prescription misuse broadly, we did not differentiate between the types of medications. Childhood family adversity During the first visit, the Risky Families Scale  assessed both nurturing and abusive aspects of the family environment during childhood. With a response scale ranging from 1 (rarely or none of the time) to 4 (most or all of the time), 11 items assessed how frequently participants experienced certain aspects, such as feeling loved and cared for; verbal abuse; and living with a substance abuser. Items were reverse-scored and summed so higher scores indicated greater childhood family adversity. Reliability in the current sample was Cronbach's α = .83. Analyses Due to the nested nature of the data and to take full advantage of the nuanced momentary-level data , 2-level generalized multilevel models (GMLM) were used. Specifically, due to the binary nature of the outcome variables, a Bernoulli distribution via logit link function was used to predict the likelihood of substance use occurring . The HLM 7 program, along with robust standard errors  and full maximum likelihood estimation via adaptive quadrature with 10 points (due to low proportional odds of the outcome variables; , were used. Four sets of models were run, each with one model for each substance type as an outcome: binge drinking, marijuana use, nicotine use, and prescription misuse. The moment-level substance use behavior was entered as a level-1 repeated measures outcome variable. Participant gender and childhood family adversity scores were entered as level-2 controls in each multilevel model to account for person-level variance in substance use explained by these variables. Random intercept models assessed whether current relationship status predicted substance use in daily life (RQ1), with relationship status entered as a level-2 intercept moderator. Random intercept models also assessed whether partner support predicted substance use in daily life (RQ2) among partnered participants, with partner support entered as an intercept moderator and relationship length and childhood family adversity entered as controls. Following standard, recommended practice, these continuous level-2 variables were grand-mean centered to reduce multicollinearity and provide meaningful intercepts . The intercept moderators are able to predict the average rate of substance use over the entire reporting period while still accounting for the within-person interdependence of the momentary data . Random slope models assessed whether real-time partner presence predicted the likelihood of substance use in the moment for partnered participants (RQ3a), with the variable for partner presence entered as a level-1 time-varying predictor. Lastly, to assess whether partner support moderated this association (RQ3b), this variable was added as a slope moderator for partner presence (cross-level interaction). To avoid conflating within-and between-person effects , the partner presence variable was group-mean centered and the participants' average score for partner presence (i.e., the ratio of reports with partner to all reports) was included in level 2. Additionally, because being with a partner and using a substance were both expected to be more likely in evening or later hours, these models also controlled for the time the report was submitted by using a dichotomous time-varying, non-random variable for Evening (0 = between 4am and 4pm; 1 = between 4pm and 4am). Partner support was also included as an intercept control. Continuous variables were again grand-mean centered. Although previous work considering similar substance use outcomes has not typically controlled for conducting multiple tests , we established a more conservative approach by decreasing the standard significance level of 0.05 by half (alpha = .025). Results Report completion statistics and substance use instances are presented in Table ; descriptive statistics and correlations in Table . There were no group differences in number of reports submitted by participants across relationship status (t (294) = -0.134, p = .894). During the EMA reporting period, the vast majority of the sample (over 95%) reported using at least one substance. Most participants (over 80%) reported at least one instance of alcohol use, with an average of about 4 instances being captured per participant using this method. About a third (34.3%) of the participants reported at least one instance of binge drinking. The majority of the sample also reported at least one instance of marijuana (58.8%) or nicotine use (60.1%). The most common form of nicotine consumption was e-cigarettes (94% of nicotine reports). About a third of the sample (35.5%) reported at least one instance of prescription misuse. RQ1: Results (Table ) indicated that current relationship status did not predict the overall likelihood of substance use for binge drinking. Partnered participants reported 43% lower average likelihood of marijuana use, 38% lower average likelihood of nicotine use, and 39% lower average likelihood of prescription misuse in daily life compared to single participants. RQ2: Results (Table ) indicated that greater partner support (oneunit increases) corresponded to a 69% decrease in the likelihood of binge drinking, along with an approximate 3-fold increase in the average likelihood of nicotine use and prescription misuse. Partner support was not related to marijuana use. RQ3: Results (Table ) indicated that participants were nearly 3 times more likely to engage in binge drinking and 1.4 times more likely to engage in marijuana use when with a partner versus not with a partner. When with a partner, prescription misuse was 55% less likely. Partner presence was not significantly associated with nicotine use. Results from the moderation models indicated that partner support did not significantly moderate the association between real-time partner presence and the likelihood of binge drinking (p = .618), marijuana use (p = .470), or prescription misuse (p = .350). However, for nicotine use, the effect of partner presence was stronger when partner support was higher. Specifically, when partner support was average (i.e., zero, due to centering), being with a partner did not significantly predict the likelihood of nicotine use (AOR for partner presence slope = 1.03, p = .616). However, greater partner support (one-unit increases) corresponded to a higher likelihood of nicotine use when with a partner, whereas lower support corresponded to a lower likelihood of nicotine use when with a partner (AOR = 1.99, p < .001). The models from RQ3 also indicated several person-level relationship factors that were included as intercept controls were significant predictors of substance use. Relationship length was associated with marijuana use, nicotine use, and prescription misuse in that for every one-month increase in relationship length above the mean, the average likelihood of use for each of these substances decreased by 1-2%; relationship length was not significantly associated with binge drinking. These results and the main results remained unchanged with the small number of extreme relationship length outliers (<2%) removed. The between-person average for partner presence was associated with greater average likelihoods of reporting binge drinking, nicotine use, and prescription misuse, but was not associated with marijuana use across the reporting period. As an intercept control, increases in partner support corresponded to a 74% decrease in the average likelihood of binge drinking and a 56% increase in the average likelihood of prescription misuse across the reporting period; the partner support intercept control was not associated with marijuana or nicotine use in these models. Discussion The goal of this study was to explore the role of romantic relationship contexts in substance use behaviors throughout the daily lives of young adult U.S. college students at increased risk of substance use. The results further highlight the importance of these young adults' interpersonal contexts in substance use behaviors and their varied, intricate associations across different substances. Notably, the person-level associations between relationship factors and substance use remained while accounting for the potential confound of childhood family adversity. As expected, the sample reported relatively higher levels of substance use than would be expected from population norms within the U. S. . In line with previous literature indicating lower overall substance use and substance problems among partnered versus single individuals , partnered participants reported less frequent marijuana use, nicotine use, and prescription misuse in their daily lives compared to single participants, and this was found in generalized multilevel models that accounted for gender, childhood family adversity, and the interdependent data. The contrast to previous studies from young adults suggesting tobacco use did not differ between partnered and single young adults  could be explained by our sample, which was more likely to use substances in general, or our inclusion of e-cigarettes, which may not limit users' partner pool to only those who can tolerate the smell of cigarette smoke; rates of e-cigarette use may be more sensitive to other relationship contexts. While speculative, understanding how secondary social factors such as odors or public use restrictions may relate to use and romantic partnering of nicotine users could further elucidate these connections. Relationship status was unrelated to binge drinking behaviors, which stands in contrast to previous findings indicating that heavy alcohol use and related substance problems are less frequent among partnered versus single young adults . Because binge drinking more often occurs late at night and therefore after the EMA signals, instances of binge drinking were likely underreported using this method. Alternatively, partnered and single substance users may binge drink about the same amount . The low prevalence of binge drinking reports could have resulted in low statistical power for detecting effects, however, the reliable effects detected in other results involving binge drinking suggest this was not an issue. When collecting EMA data multiple times each day, binge drinking is a relatively uncommon behavior ; future researchers exploring multiple types of substance use behaviors in daily life (versus retrospectively) may consider employing different methods of data collection suited to each substance's typical use. Indeed, such research on multiple or poly-substance use is needed given that the use of one substance often coincides with the use of other substances (e.g., . While investigating the copious potential forms of polysubstance use across these four substances was well beyond the scope of the current study, this highly complex and often overlooked issue has been recognized as an important area for future research (UNODC, 2018). For individuals in relationships, we tested whether partner support-an essential component of romantic relationship quality -was related to substance use behaviors in this sample. Higher support was related to lower binge drinking and marijuana use, as expected, yet related to higher nicotine use and higher prescription misuse. Findings echo recent studies suggesting complex associations between relationship quality and substance use behaviors. Note. N = 296 participants.

Table 5 Adjusted odds ratios from generalized multilevel models: Partner presence predicting moment-level substance use in daily life.  For instance, substances such as alcohol may decrease maladaptive problem-solving behaviors during conflict interactions for those in distressed relationships , suggesting an explanation for why use may be higher among lower-quality relationships. Alcohol use with a romantic partner can also increase feelings of intimacy , indicating that the use of some substances may increase relationship quality via shared activities, for example, or could artificially increase perceptions of such quality. Taken together, findings suggest that high-quality relationships alone are not protective against substance use behaviors. While positive and supportive social relationships such as romantic partnerships are critical for supporting healthy behaviors , other individual, relational, and societal factors also play important roles. One relational variable likely relevant is the partner's substance use, which has consistently been associated with concurrent and subsequent substance use among adolescents and young adults . While assessing partner's substance use was beyond the scope of the current individual-based study, we were able to capture another relational component that has not been directly tested before: partner presence during moments of substance use. Binge drinking and marijuana use were more likely in moments when partnered participants were with their romantic partners, and this was found when accounting for evening-time hours (and other controls). Again, data was likely not representative of all binge drinking instances, but this was a robust finding. For the instances of binge drinking and marijuana use captured via the EMA, they were more likely to occur when a romantic partner was present. For nicotine use, partner presence became a significant predictor when partner support was entered as a moderator. These results reiterate the notion that substance use is often a social behavior  and that couples often use substances together (e.g., . Conversely, partner presence did not significantly predict prescription misuse. Prescription drugs are often misused for the therapeutic purposes for which they were intended, such as for treating pain or sleep disorders or enhancing focus for academic study (e.g., . Assessing motivations behind substance use was beyond the scope of the current study, but the negative association between partner presence and prescription misuse could be explained by the more practical (i.e., less recreational) nature of this type of substance use. When substances are used for more practical purposes, such as self-medicating or academic enhancement, the social context of a relationship may be less important in that moment. Some additional support for this explanation is offered by the evening-time control variable, which indicated that binge drinking, marijuana use, and nicotine use were more likely to occur in the evening or late night hours (suggesting a recreational purpose), yet the time of day did not predict the likelihood of prescription misuse. This corroborates other studies indicating that social contexts differ across substance type, with alcohol and marijuana being more socially oriented and prescription misuse more solitary , and further indicates associations with relationship contexts are likely not equivalent across substances. Future research on the differences in social use of substances, and therefore how susceptible their use may be to romantic relationship contexts or to the drug-related attitudes of the partners, could prove useful for intervention efforts. The association between partner presence and substance use was not significantly moderated by partner support for any substance use behaviors except for nicotine use. Specifically, the more supportive the relationship, the more likely nicotine use became when with a partner. For less supportive relationships, being with a partner reduced the likelihood of nicotine use. This finding from momentary experiences of substance use mirrors retrospective studies of couple substance use indicating that when substances are used together, relationship quality is higher (or vise-versa; . The findings also speak to the importance of how partners connect and what substances might be bringing to their relationships, such as feelings of intimacy or improved relationship functioning . It is important to note that the instances of substance use among partnered participants were even lower than expected (especially binge drinking and prescription misuse; nicotine was most frequent) and could have resulted in these exploratory moderation analyses being underpowered; nevertheless, we present the findings here as a starting point for future studies. Given the purpose of the larger project was to collect real-time predictors of prescription drug misuse, the recruitment strategies highlighted the health-based focus of the study and did not mention romantic relationships. This may have resulted in a wider array of romantic relationships regarding levels of support than are typically found in relationship-focused studies. This could also be a reason why the Partner Strain items exhibited poor reliability-psychometric properties previously documented for this scale were largely based on relationshipfocused studies, which may not have included relationships exhibiting higher or more variable levels of strain. While potentially allowing for a more complete picture of how relationships are linked to substance use, it also points to the need for establishing scale reliability more broadly. Limitations The design and sample were optimized to capture the everyday contexts of prescription misuse behaviors in daily life. While ideal for the intended goal, this likely resulted in less representative samples of other substance use behaviors, limited generalizability to other young adult college students or to those within different geographical and cultural spaces, and unknown differences in results between prescription misuse and the other substance use behaviors. The design was correlational and findings should not be interpreted as causation; indeed, substance use may influence relationship outcomes, as use and relationships are bidirectionally interconnected . Further, assessing partner characteristics, such as substance use, relationship quality, or gender, was beyond the scope of the current large, multifaceted study, yet represent important next steps as substance use within romantic relationships is highly interdependent and likely influenced by the dyadic nature of relationship quality , and that substance use disorders are disproportionately high among sexual minority subgroups . The study design also prevented identifying changes in partner status after the first lab visit, whether participants were dating each other, or whether reports were event-versus time-based, which may indicate important theoretical or statistical nuances, and are important factors to consider in future research. Standard measures of socioeconomic status (SES) were not collected, precluding comparisons across SES. The full-time undergraduate standing at a large state university that is generally attended by students from higher SES backgrounds does indicate a high sample-average SES. While this is typical for young adult U.S. college students (the population of interest), it does represent a limitation. Specifically, the welldocumented systemic inequities that introduce barriers to higher education among historically disadvantaged groups , such as those with low SES, leaves these groups underrepresented, therefore deterring a full understanding of how substance use and romantic partnerships are linked. Given that such underrepresented groups report relatively lower academic success , and that substance use is linked to academic outcomes (UNODC, 2018), understanding these associations among students from underrepresented groups could provide critical information for those seeking to improve academic and health outcomes for these students. Lastly, it is important to note that a clear line between substance use that is problematic versus harmless or even medicinal is often difficult to discern, and this study did not differentiate between problematic and more casual substance use behaviors. Nevertheless, documenting what factors are associated with more or less substance use in daily life is an important step in preventing problematic substance use in this at-risk population of college students. Conclusions Our findings suggest that, for young adult college students who use substances, substance use behaviors in daily life are strongly linked to romantic relationship factors. While being in a romantic relationship may make substance use less frequent overall, some (but not all) substance use behaviors are more likely when romantic partners are together. High-quality relationships are not universally protective against substance use; problematic substance use can occur even in highly supportive relationships. Results suggest that, depending on the partners' social contexts and substance use characteristics, health behavior interventions designed to strengthen social support and intimate bonds among romantic partners may inadvertently provide avenues for increased substance use; given the established value of social support in health behaviors, more research is needed to confirm these potential nuances. The varying relationship contexts that may make some substance use behaviors more or less likely-both between and within individuals-as documented here represent fruitful paths for further in-depth research and effective prevention efforts.

Conclusion. Our findings suggest that prenatal loss in a prior pregnancy is associated with a subsequent pregnancy with significantly higher stress and impaired mood levels in everyday life across gestation. These findings have important implications for designing EMA-based ambulatory, personalized interventions to reduce stress during pregnancy in this high-risk group. Background The prevalence among women of childbearing age of prenatal loss, the loss of an unborn child during pregnancy through miscarriage or stillbirth, is substantial, with one out of five women experiencing a miscarriage (loss of an embryo or fetus before the 20th week of gestation), and one out of 160 women experiencing a stillbirth (loss of a fetus occurring after the 20th week of gestation and a weight above 500 g) . The negative consequences on women's mental health of losing an unborn child have been reported in several studies: prenatal loss is related to a higher risk for psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, and major depression (reviewed in Engelhard, . Over 80% of women who experience prenatal loss become pregnant within the subsequent 12-month period , and it is therefore likely that the negative effects of prenatal loss on maternal psychological well-being may extend to the subsequent pregnancy. Given the prominent role of maternal psychological state during pregnancy in many critical pregnancy, birth and offspring developmental and health outcomes , it is crucially important to determine the relationship of a previous prenatal loss on maternal psychological well-being during a subsequent pregnancy. Previous studies on the association between prenatal loss and maternal psychological state in a subsequent pregnancy have focused primarily on maternal anxiety and depression . These previous studies have several limitations. First, the majority of these studies have focused on clinical diagnoses of psychiatric disorders , thereby precluding the ascertainment of whether this relationship is evident with variation in maternal psychosocial distress and affective state along a continuum, potentially below clinical thresholds. The clinical relevance of maternal psychological state in pregnancy is not restricted to psychopathology but is evident along a continuum (reviewed in . Second, previous study on the association of prenatal loss with maternal psychological well-being has relied exclusively on the use of traditional, retrospective recall-based measures to characterize maternal psychological state (for a meta-analytic overview, refer . Respondents are typically asked to rate how stressed, anxious, or depressed they have felt over the past week/month/since the beginning of their pregnancy. These traditional measures are prone to retrospective recall bias , thereby limiting their validity. In addition, most participants are asked to fill out the questionnaires in either a clinical or research laboratory setting, thereby potentially limiting their generalizability (ecological validity) to everyday real-life situations and circumstances. Third, the majority of previous studies have incorporated only one measurement time point, in either early or late pregnancy; only 4 of 19 previous studies have used a longitudinal study design ; refer recent metaanalysis by . It may be particularly important to assess maternal psychological state longitudinally across pregnancy because the association between history of prenatal loss and maternal psychological state may change across the course of gestation. Once the critical hallmark of 20th week of gestation is passed the risk for prenatal loss decreases significantly , potentially contributing to improvements in maternal well-being in the second half of pregnancy. This issue may have clinical relevance because studies of the effects of maternal stress during pregnancy have reported differential effects depending on the gestational time window of its occurrence . Fourth, several of the previous studies are limited in terms of study design, particularly the lack of appropriate comparison groups. For example, some studies have included in the comparison group a combination of women who were pregnant for the first time and also women who were pregnant at least one time before the current (index) pregnancy, whereas the group of women with a history of prenatal loss include, obviously, only multigravida (women who were pregnant at least once before), and these studies did not adjust for gravida or parity status . Because the event/experience of a prior pregnancy might be associated with biological and psychological changes , this could potentially confound the association between history of prenatal loss and psychological state in a subsequent pregnancy. We note that in the current study we addressed this issue by including parity status as a covariate in all analysis. In addition, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by examining the effect of prenatal loss on our study outcomes in the study's subpopulation of multigravid women. Fifth, several studies have failed to account for other important potential confounders associated with both risk for prenatal loss and impairments in mental well-being, such as sociodemographic factors (e.g. income, maternal age) and obstetric characteristics (e.g. obstetric risk factors;  EMA methods can address several of these above-discussed limitations by employing repeated real-time measurements of psychological states in participants' natural daily environments, thereby minimize biases associated with retrospective recall measures to provide more accurate and ecologically valid measures of psychological/behavioral states . Thus, the aim of the current study was to examine the association of history of prenatal loss with assessments during a subsequent pregnancy in early as well as late gestation of maternal psychological state (maternal momentary pregnancy-specific distress and mood) using EMA methods. Materials and methods Participants The study was conducted at the Institute of Medical Psychology and the Department of Obstetrics at the Charité Universtitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany. Women with a singleton, intrauterine pregnancy were recruited prior to 16 weeks gestation. Exclusion criteria were twin pregnancies, uterine, placental/cord anomalies, fetal congenital malformations, and systemic corticosteroid intake. The study protocol included two study visits at the laboratory during early (T1: 12-16 weeks gestation) and late pregnancy (T2: 30-34 weeks gestation), followed by a 4-day EMA period, as described below. The Charité Institutional Review Board approved the study, and all participants provided written, informed consent. The characteristics of the study participants are presented in Table . Miscarriage was defined as the loss of an unborn child during a recognized pregnancy before the 20th week of gestation, and if gestational age (GA) is not available, fetal weight equal or below 500 g . Prenatal losses occurring after the 20th week of gestation and a weight above 500 g were termed stillbirths . In total, 25.8% of the participating women reported the experience of prenatal loss, either miscarriage or stillbirth, in a previous pregnancy (N = 40). 5.8% reported two prenatal losses, and 1.9% reported more than two prenatal losses (N = 3) in their reproductive history. The prevalence of obstetric complications during pregnancy was low in our study population (5.8%). Measures Maternal characteristics At each visit, trained study personnel conducted structured interviews to obtain information on sociodemographic characteristics 2 Claudia Lazarides et al. and reproductive history (e.g. gravidity, parity, number of previous pregnancy losses), and estimated date of conception. GA at visit was computed based on early ultrasound measurements. Data on obstetric risk factors were abstracted from the medical record. EMA-based measures of maternal psychological state We assessed momentary maternal pregnancy-specific distress and mood using an EMA protocol for ambulatory, real-time measurement of affective states. The EMA protocol was delivered through the mobile phone application movisensXS (movisensXS; movisens, 2020). The 4-day EMA protocol spanned two consecutive weekdays and a weekend (Thursday-Sunday, or Saturday-Tuesday). Participants were provided a smartphone with an electronic diary application. Throughout the EMA period, participants were prompted on average eight times per day (prompts were between 30 and 90 min apart between the hours of 8AM and 8PM). Pregnancy-specific distress (PSD_mean; Rini, Dunkel-Schetter,  was assessed by inquiring about the woman's feelings (happiness and ambivalence) about being pregnant, her concerns about the baby's health, bodily discomfort due to pregnancy-related changes, and concerns about giving birth. Women rated these items on a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 5 ('not at all' to 'completely'). Participants' ratings at each prompt were aggregated across all items and average scores were computed. The measure of pregnancy-specific stress was chosen for this study because measures that assess distress in a specific area of life may better reflect individual responses to these conditions than global stress questionnaires . This pregnancy-specific distress measure has previously been linked to pregnancy and offspring outcomes (e.g. . Maternal momentary mood was measured by the multidimensional mood questionnaire (MDBF) developed for daily diary research and validated for EMA studies . Participants rated their momentary mood along three dimensions: valence (good-bad mood, GB), arousal (calmness-nervousness, CN), and tiredness (alertness-tiredness, AT) on 12 items, four items for each dimension, with a balanced number of negatively worded and positively worded items. Items were rated on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 5 ('not at all' to 'completely'). Positively worded items were reversed before aggregating answers to derive an average score for each dimension (good-bad mood: GB_mean, calmnervous: CN_mean, alert-tired: AT_mean) for each prompt. The derived original scores were reversed to ease the interpretation of the results such that higher average scores for each dimension indicate an unfavorable affective state (bad mood, nervous, tired), and lower average scores indicate favorable affective states (good mood, calm, alert). Statistical analysis We performed all statistical analyses in R version 3.5.1 (R Development Core Team, 2018). The R-package nlme version 3.1-137 was used for linear mixed model analyses (Pinheiro, Bates, DebRoy, Sarkar, & R Core Team, 2018). Variance decomposition of momentary measures We used linear mixed(-effect) models (LMMs; cf. multilevel models) to identify the proportion of variance at the different levels of  . Psychological Medicine the data (momentary, day, stage of pregnancy and participant level;  with regard to pregnancy-specific distress and the three mood dimensions (valence, arousal, and tiredness). The applied analytical procedure has been described in detail elsewhere . In four separate 4-level random intercept LMMs, the percentage of total variance for pregnancy-specific distress, valence, arousal, and tiredness was computed at the level of the momentary measurements (level 1), days (level 2), stages of pregnancy (level 3), and participants (level 4). To account for the unequal spacing of the auto-correlated measurements across a day a continuous time-autoregressive covariance structure of order one was specified using time since wake in minutes . Restricted maximum likelihood was used for parameter estimation (for R code, see online Supplement A1). Linear mixed models EMA-based measures. To examine the effect of history of prenatal loss on pregnancy-specific distress and momentary maternal mood along the three dimensions valence, arousal, and tiredness, four separate 4-level LMMs were fitted to the nested data with the same random effect structure as described for the variance decomposition of EMA-based measures. We used the same continuous-autoregressive covariance structure to account for unequal temporal spacing of the momentary measurements. The exemplary R code is provided in online Supplement A2. Prenatal loss status (history of prenatal loss yes/no) was used as a dichotomous predictor. Relevant covariates (described below) were included as fixed effects in all models. Moderation by stage of pregnancy. To explore how potential differences in psychological state between women with and without a history of prenatal loss may change with advancing gestation, we included the interaction term between stage of pregnancy (i.e. visit number, T1 and T2) and prenatal loss status in the linear mixed models described above (R code, see online Supplement A3). Sensitivity analysis. The control group included women who were pregnant for the first time and women who were pregnant at least one time before the current pregnancy, whereas the group of women with a history of prenatal loss included only multigravida (multigravida = women that were pregnant at least once before). Because the experience of prior pregnancy may be associated with biological and psychological changes , this could introduce heterogeneity in the control group and limit the validity of reported differences in psychological well-being between women with and without prenatal loss. We therefore conducted a sensitivity analysis by testing our hypothesis in only multi-gravid women. Covariates All analyses were adjusted for the effects of potential confounders that have previously been associated with the risk for prenatal loss and impaired psychological well-being, including maternal age, parity (not included as a covariate in the sensitivity analyses), obstetric risk factors, and income . The following covariates were included as fixed effects in all described LMMs (R code, see online Supplement A1): stage of pregnancy (early -T1 v. late pregnancy -T2), maternal age at first visit, income, parity category (0nulliparous, 1multiparous; not included in sensitivity analyses described above), obstetric risk factor (presence of any of the following conditions during the current pregnancy: preeclampsia, hypertension, gestational diabetes coded with '1', no obstetric risk factors present coded with '0'). Compliance and handling of missing data Given the EMA protocol, each time a participant refrained from answering a prompt, declined to answer, ignored a prompt or did not conclude the entire survey, the smartphone application recorded a missing value. To assess compliance, we calculated the percent of missing prompts of the total number of prompts. In the statistical analyses, missing data were accounted for by use of full information restricted maximum likelihood estimation . Thus, LMMs make use of all available data. Results EMA-based measures of maternal psychological state Compliance Compliance with the EMA protocol (number of missing prompts relative to the total number of prompts) was 86.3%, which is above the recommended 80% for EMA-studies, and also above average compliance of 75-78% previously reported in two meta-analyses comprised of 168 EMA studies . Variance decomposition The variance decomposition indicates the amount of the total variation in pregnancy-specific distress, valence, arousal, and tiredness that is derived from the different levels of the data (i.e. variation between individuals as well as within individuals, across the stages of pregnancy, across a day, and across moments; de . Based on the LMM, pregnancyspecific distress scores varied largely between individuals (68.4%) and to a lesser extent from moment to moment (12.1%), and from early to late pregnancy (16.9%), as well as to a small degree from day to day (5.1%; summary of results is given in online Supplementary Table , detailed results in online Supplementary Table ). For the mood scales, GB_mean, CN_mean, and AT_mean, predominantly showed variation at the momentary level (48.8-54.3%) and between individuals (27.6-38.9%) rather than from day to day (7.1-10.2%) or from early to late pregnancy (3.7-5.9%; summary of results is given in online Supplementary Table , detailed results in online Supplementary Tables ). Intraclass correlation coefficients reflected this pattern of variation (online Supplementary Table ). Descriptive statistics Summary statistics for pregnancy-specific distress and for each MDBF scale (valence, arousal, tiredness) are displayed separately for each time point (stage of pregnancy) in Table . Pregnancy-specific distress decreased slightly from early to late pregnancy in the whole sample. In general, mood improved from early to late gestation, as suggested by a decrease in mood valence (GB_mean), arousal (CN_mean) and level of tiredness (AT_mean) in the whole sample. The observed average and variation of mood scores are comparable with published norms for women in reproductive age . History of prenatal loss and EMA measures of psychological state during pregnancy An overview of the results of the linear mixed-effects model analysis is displayed in Table . More detailed results for each outcome are presented in online Supplementary Tables . Pregnancy-specific distress There was a significant effect of history of prenatal loss on pregnancy-specific distress: women with a history of prenatal loss reported significantly higher levels of pregnancy-specific distress assessed at a momentary level, in early as well as in late gestation (B = 0.465, p = 0.004, online Supplementary Table ). On average, women with a history of prenatal loss reported 0.465-unit higher levels of pregnancy-specific distress on a scale from to those without a history of prenatal loss. Mood valence, arousal, and tiredness There was no significant main effect of prenatal loss status on mood valence (GB_mean) albeit mood was slightly impaired in women with a history of prenatal loss compared to those without across the course of pregnancy (B = 0.214, p = 0.070, online Supplementary Table ). Arousal was positively associated with prenatal loss status (CN_mean: B = 0.247, p = 0.047, online Supplementary Table ): across gestation, women with a history of prenatal loss showed increased arousal compared to women without prenatal loss, and were more tired (AT_mean: B = 0.293, p = 0.026, online Supplementary Table ). Women with prenatal loss showed on average a 0.247-unit higher level of arousal and a 0.270-unit higher level of tiredness. Moderation of the association between history of prenatal loss and EMA measures of psychological state by stage of pregnancy There was no main effect of stage of pregnancy on levels of pregnancy-specific distress (PSD_mean: B = −0.0002, p = 0.997, online Supplementary Table ). However, the moderation analysis revealed a significant positive interaction effect between stage of pregnancy and prenatal loss status (PSD_mean: B = 0.314, p = 0.012). As displayed in Fig. , pregnancy-specific distress decreased from early to late gestation in women without a history of prenatal loss, whereas it increased in women with a history of prenatal loss. Across the whole sample, momentary maternal mood including valence (impaired mood), arousal, and tiredness decreased significantly across pregnancy (GB_mean: B = −0.110, p = 0.003; CN_mean: B = −0.118, p = 0.003; AT_mean: B = −0.100, p = 0.042; online Supplementary Tables ), indicating a general improvement of mood across the whole sample. We therefore conducted a moderation analysis to test if the effect of prenatal loss on mood dimensions was moderated by the stage of pregnancy. The moderation analysis revealed a significant interaction effect of stage of pregnancy and prenatal loss status on arousal (CN_mean: B = 0.184, p = 0.045, Fig. ). Women without a history of prenatal loss reported lower levels of arousal in late compared to early gestation, while levels did not decrease in women with a history of prenatal loss. There was no significant interaction effect of stage of pregnancy and prenatal loss status on mood valence and tiredness (GB_mean: B = 0.142, p = 0.090; AT_mean: B = 0.116, p = 0.317). Sensitivity analysis When considering only women who were pregnant at least one time before the current pregnancy (40 women with and 39 without a history of prenatal loss), most of the previously reported effects remained unchanged in direction, magnitude, and significance level. Specifically, women with a history of prenatal loss reported higher levels of pregnancy-specific distress (PSD_mean: B = 0.482, p = 0.039), and were more nervous (CN_mean: B = 0.359, p = 0.037), more tired (AT_mean: B = 0.494, p = 0.003), across pregnancy compared to women without prenatal loss. Furthermore, there was a trend for an effect of prenatal loss status on mood valence when only including   . Psychological Medicine 5 multigravid women. Women with a history of prenatal loss reported impaired mood compared to women without prenatal loss (GB_mean: B = 0.294, p = 0.081). Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use the EMA approach to comprehensively (i.e. serially, at a momentary level, across everyday life situations) quantify and compare stress and mood levels and trajectories in pregnancy in women with and without a prior history of prenatal loss. Our findings indicate that women with a prior history of prenatal loss experienced significantly more pregnancy-related stress and felt significantly more nervous and tired compared to those who have not previously experienced a prenatal loss. Moreover, our results suggest that these differences persisted and even grew or became amplified as pregnancy progressed. Maternal levels of stress and negative affect progressively decreased over the course of pregnancy in women without a history of prenatal loss, whereas they did not change or even increased in women with a prior history of prenatal loss. The magnitude of this observed difference is striking. Women in the prior prenatal loss group exhibited, on average, 38.6% more pregnancy-specific stress, 18.3% more arousal, and 15.5% more exhaustion than those in the comparison group †1 . The present study was not designed to address the clinical relevance of observed findings. Because the vast majority of studies of the effects of maternal stress in pregnancy have relied on the The notes appear after the main text. 1 The reported percentages are based on the group means of the respective outcomes across measurement time points. These effect quantifications do not account for the nesting of the data, group sizes, variation within groups, and potential effect of covariates which were rather small in this sample. Therefore, these approximate effect sizes should be interpreted under these limitations. more traditional retrospective recall approach to quantify stress, as opposed to the EMA approach used in the current study, it is difficult to directly extrapolate clinical significance. We note, nevertheless, that several previous studies have reported that differences of comparable or even smaller magnitude in maternal stress during and/or across pregnancy have been independently associated with a range of adverse maternal, birth and child developmental and health outcomes, including premature birth, newborn and infant adiposity, neurodevelopmental deficits, and even cellular measures of aging (telomere length) . Based on this observation we submit it is likely that the magnitude of the observed difference in maternal stress in the current study may portend clinical significance. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies that find women report increased levels of post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression following pregnancy loss . Across time, grief subsides and psychiatric disorders possibly remit, although, the emotional perturbations related to the experience of pregnancy loss remain . A subsequent pregnancy has the potential to reactivate the affective memories associated with the past prenatal loss . The current study highlights the relevance of history of prenatal loss as a risk factor for increased prenatal stress in pregnancy and thus the potential negative consequences on pregnancy, birth and child development, and health outcomes. In the current study, we observed an overall improvement across pregnancy in psychological well-being. This observation is consistent with recent evidence from a clinical population of pregnant women, who reported a decrease in psychopathological symptoms from early to late pregnancy (Asselmann, Kunas,  Psychological Medicine 7 Wittchen, & Martini, 2020). This general improvement of wellbeing and decrease in psychological stress may be associated with the attenuation of maternal biological stress responsivity across pregnancy . However, in our study, women with a history of prenatal loss did not exhibit this decrease in stress and improvement in mood across pregnancy, which may be a consequence of their prior traumatic experience of losing a pregnancy and the resultant general feeling of uncontrollability. We have previously reported that the lack of stress attenuation across pregnancy is related to adverse pregnancy outcomes . We suggest that our study has several strengths. As of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the effect of a history of prenatal loss on maternal psychological state in early and late pregnancy. We use EMA methods to assess maternal stress in women's everyday life in natural settings in contrast to previous research that exclusively relied on traditional retrospective questionnaires. Participants of the current study showed a high compliance with the EMA protocol. We assessed psychological state on a continuum, and relied on measures of mood and stress rather than focusing on clinical symptom categories or psychiatric diagnoses. We adjusted our analyses for the effect of important potential confounders, including sociodemographic factors, obstetric characteristics and number of previous pregnancies. By means of a sensitivity analysis within multigravida women only, we confirm the robustness of our results. Some limitations of the current study need to be acknowledged. First, data on psychological state was available only for the current pregnancy, measures of psychological state prior to the initial prenatal loss were not available. Stress has been discussed as a risk factor for prenatal loss. However, previous studies investigating whether maternal psychological stress predicts prenatal loss have produced mixed results . All our analyses were adjusted for covariates potentially associated with both risk for prenatal loss and maternal psychological state, including maternal age, parity, obstetric risk, and household income. Second, we were unable to test the effect of the number of previous prenatal losses on psychological state during pregnancy due to the relatively small number of women who miscarried more than once. Previous large cohort studies suggest that with increasing number of prenatal losses women report even higher levels of depression and anxiety . We therefore submit that our findings may represent a conservative estimate of the true effect of history of prenatal loss on psychological state during pregnancy. Third, data on the length of interpregnancy intervals as well as on a whether or not women gave birth to a living child between the pregnancy loss and the current pregnancy were not available, and we were therefore unable to test the moderating effects of these variables. Previous studies suggest that the length of the inter-pregnancy interval does not affect the association between history of prenatal loss and depression and/or anxiety during a subsequent pregnancy or in the postpartum period . A large longitudinal cohort study reports a robust association between history of prenatal loss with increased levels of anxiety and depression during a subsequent pregnancy, which remained stable across the pre-and postnatal period of the index pregnancy, thereby indicating that the psychological impairment associated with previous prenatal loss might not attenuate significantly following the birth of a living child . Fourth, EMA studies assess the participants' psychological state repeatedly across multiple days raising the issue of measurement reactivity. However, previous EMA studies have provided no evidence for measurement reactivity with regard to mood, craving, body image, and suicidal thoughts . The findings of our study suggest that women with a history of prenatal loss are at increased risk for experiencing higher levels of stress during pregnancy. Although, obstetric guidelines issued by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advice perinatal care providers to screen for postpartum depression, recommendations to not include screening for psychological stress (American Academy of Pediatrics & American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2017). Our results imply that pregnancy-specific distress might be a good screening tool for this purpose, since the effect on pregnancy loss on pregnancy specific distress in our study was substantial, and it primarily varied between individuals and may not have to be measured that frequently. The current study underscores the importance of using EMA methods in assessing stress and mood in the context of pregnancy, which then could be used to design personalized interventions to reduce maternal stress. EMA-based measures of psychological states can be used to estimate subject-specific 'moments at risk', such as the deviation from the individual average stress level in a given moment, that have a higher predictive value for maternal cortisol levels during pregnancy than traditional approaches . Future studies could test the efficacy of EMA-based targeted interventions in women with a history of prenatal loss. Given its substantial burden on maternal and offspring health, reducing stress during pregnancy in this high risk group could yield considerable public health benefit.  "
34,34,"Stress, alcohol use, and punitive parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Emerging research suggests that parents are experiencing heightened stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parental stress is a risk factor for harsh or punitive parenting, and this association may be exacerbated by the use of alcohol. Objective: We examine whether parental stress is associated with use of punitive parenting, as well as whether this association is modified by drinking pattern. Participants & setting: We used advertisements and word-of-mouth to recruit 342 parents living in Central Ohio during the initial stay-at-home order for COVID-19. Methods: We used geographic ecological momentary assessment (gEMA) to measure parental stress and punitive parenting during three time periods (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.) over a period of fourteen days using an app downloaded to their cellular telephone. Participants also completed a longer baseline survey. We used nested multilevel ordinal regression models, where at-themoment assessments (Level 1) were nested within individuals (Level 2) to analyze data. Results: Higher levels of parental stress [OR = 1.149 (95 % CI = 1.123, 1.176)] and later time of day [OR = 1.255 (95 % CI = 1.146, 1.373)] were positively related to odds of punitive parenting. Drinking pattern was not significantly related to punitive parenting in models with demographic covariates. Parents who drank alcohol both monthly and weekly and had higher levels of stress had greater odds of punitive parenting than parents with high levels of stress who abstain from alcohol. Conclusions: Alcohol may be an accelerant in the use of punitive parenting for parents experiencing stress. As alcohol use increases during COVID-19, children may be at higher risk for punitive parenting.","[""Child maltreatment"", ""Alcohol use"", ""Stress"", ""COVID-19"", ""Survey research""]",10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105090,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted the lives of Americans. As of December 2020, an estimated 288,000 Americans have died due to complications from the virus, while an additional 15 million have contracted the virus (Centers for Disease . As many as 55 % of those who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 may experience lasting negative side effects . The impact on the economy has also been significant, with decreased labor force participation, particularly for women and people of color . Initial international reports suggest approximately 30 % of the global general population experienced stress during the first months of the pandemic . Parenting and stress during COVID-19 pandemic Parents may be particularly impacted by social changes due to the pandemic. Across the country, many schools closed or moved to hybrid in-person/on-line and preschools and childcare centers temporarily or permanently shuttered . As a result, many parents found themselves either working from home with children present, or unable to find childcare in order to continue working. Emerging research suggests that parents reported heightened stress or distress during the pandemic as compared to previous levels, potentially stemming from lack of childcare or fear of the virus itself . Parenting stress occurs when parents perceive themselves to be overwhelmed by or in-equipped to cope with issues related to parenting.  argues that parental stress is a function of characteristics of both the child and parent, as well as contextual environmental factors . The COVID-19 pandemic is one such environmental factor that could contribute to parenting stress, through the societal re-structuring of sheltering-in-place (e.g. schools transitioning to distance learning and working from home with children present) . Approximately 46 % of parents reported high levels of stress during COVID-19, in comparison to 28 % of adults without children . COVID-19-related cumulative stressors are related to parental stress levels . Parental stress has long been a major risk factor for harsh or punitive parenting . Punitive parenting is behavior directed towards a child that is physically or emotionally harsh and asserts power over children . Punitive parenting has been related to various negative outcomes for children, including depression, anxiety, and externalizing behavior . An initial field of research suggests that high levels of stress or related factors due to COVID-19 are associated with negative parenting. For example, greater parenting stress during the pandemic is associated with less involvement with children's activities . Having more depressive symptoms or losing a job during the pandemic are related to psychological maltreatment among parents . Another recent study found that parents who reported greater impact of the COVID-19 pandemic also experienced higher levels of parenting stress, which was in turn associated with harsh parenting . Having high levels of caregiving stress (assessed during COVID-19 but not exclusive to that time period) was associated with psychological aggression, corporal punishment and neglect among grandparent caregivers . Finally, higher levels of parental distress related to COVID-19 were associated with harsh discipline among parents in the Northeastern US . Taken together, this emerging research suggests that children may be at enhanced risk of punitive parenting during the COVID-19 epidemic, due to increased parental stress. Stress and alcohol use during COVID-19 pandemic Parental stress related to COVID-19 could also contribute to an increase in alcohol consumption. The motivational model of alcohol use argues that one of the main motivations for drinking is to cope with negative emotions . Previous research has found that stressful life events and past year stress are related to alcohol consumption and problematic drinking . Men and women may have greater desire to drink on days with more stressful events . The COVID-19 pandemic, which may have led to increased stress, may consequently increase alcohol use through coping-motivated drinking. Several recent studies support this possibility, as stress during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased drinking . In addition, COVID-19-related distress is associated with drinking-related coping, which in turn is related to increased frequency and quantity of alcohol use . While this previous research has examined general population samples, studies that have specifically investigated the role of parenting in alcohol consumption during COVID-19 suggest that parents may be at even higher risk of increased consumption. A study of Canadian drinkers found that having children at home was associated with drinking-related coping, which was in turn related to increased alcohol consumption and resultant problems . Similarly, having a child in the home was positively related to the number of heavy drinking episodes and number of typical drinks . The stresses of COVID-19 for parents, including virtual learning, increased childcare burden, and dealing with bored and under-stimulated children could thus lead parents to drinking-related coping. Stress, alcohol and parenting during COVID-19 pandemic The combination of increased parental stress and alcohol consumption during COVID-19 could heighten risk for punitive parenting. Greater frequency and quantity of drinking is associated with physical abuse, corporal punishment, and psychological aggression ;). Alcohol use can limit behavioral inhibitions , potentially leading to use of punitive parenting at high levels of stress. As a result, frequent alcohol use could modify the association between parental stress and use of punitive parenting. In this study, we examine associations between parental stress, drinking frequency, and punitive parenting in a sample of parents in Central Ohio. The study used cell-phone based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to survey parents 42 times during a two-week period about their experiences and behaviors. The data were collected at the height of the shelter-in-place order in Ohio due to COVID-19, April-May of 2020. We explore the following: 1.) Do parents who report higher levels of stress through the data collection period have higher odds of using punitive parenting?; 2.) Is the association between stress and punitive parenting modified by drinking frequency? Methods Study Design. We conducted a geographic ecological momentary assessment (gEMA) with 342 parents living in Central Ohio during the initial stay-at-home order for COVID-19. This multi-level study includes observations (Level 1) within individuals (Level 2). IRB approval was obtained by [blinded for review]. Study participants were recruited through social media websites and word of mouth (e. g. friends told other friends about the study). Those interested in participating were asked to complete a short online screening survey so we could assess eligibility. Participants needed to have at least one child between the ages of 2 and 12, have custody of that child at least 50 % of the time, live in a seven county area in central Ohio, speak English, be 18 years or older, and use a smart cellular telephone with GPS capability. Parents with more than one child in the target age range were asked to pick a focal child (i.e. the child with the most recent birthday) and answer questions about that child specifically. We contacted participants via email or text to set up a time to complete the informed consent process via telephone. Participants were asked to provide verbal consent. We asked participants to undertake three activities as part of the study: (1) complete a 30-45 minute online survey at baseline; (2) complete EMA surveys by answering 3-5 questions during three time periods (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.) each day for fourteen days using an app downloaded to their cellular telephone; and (3) allow us to geotrack their movements over the fourteen day time period with that same app. The baseline survey collected information on parenting behaviors, stress, alcohol use and demographics about the family, the parent, and the focal child. EMA surveys asked parents about their current stress level, their location when completing the survey, whether their child was with the parent since the last survey, and, if present, whether they had used two punitive or two nonpunitive behaviors. Given the stay-at-home order, geographic variability in movement was likely considerably lower than during more usual circumstances. We do not include those geographic data in this study. Data collection occurred between April 13, 2020 and May 27, 2020. Ohio's stay-at-home orders began on March 24, 2020 and most businesses were opened with restrictions by May 12, 2020. Participants were given incentives based on their level of involvement throughout the study. Those who completed the baseline survey and downloaded the app received a $50 incentive. Two parents had cellular telephones that were running versions of operating systems that were too old to download the app; while they received the $50 for completing the baseline survey, they did not participate in the remaining study activities. For each ecological momentary assessment (EMA) completed, participants earned $1. Completing all three assessment in a day resulted in an additional $2, for a daily total of $5. If they completed 90 % of all EMA surveys, they were eligible for an additional $10. Ninety-one percent of the participants completed more than 90 % of all EMA surveys. Participants who allowed their location to be tracked every day during the 14-day study period received an additional $20. The total possible incentive that could be received was $150. Participants We had 629 individuals complete our screening survey. Of those, 479 met the eligibility criteria for the study. We enrolled 342 individuals into the study (71.40 % of those eligible). The primary reasons for not enrolling participants in the study included no follow up by the participant after completing the initial screening, inability to find a time to complete the consent process, and potential participants not keeping their informed consent appointments. Of the 342 parents that provided verbal informed consent and did enroll in the study, nine did not complete any study activities, two parents completed only the ecological momentary assessments, and one completed only the baseline survey. In our analytic sample, we also removed one case with missing data on our alcohol use measure. Our final number of participants in this study was 329 parents. These parents completed 12,099 daily assessments, an average of 36.8 (or 88 %) of the 42 assessments. Our participants in the study are primarily female (92.7 %), highly educated (41.6 % have a graduate degree), and drink alcohol weekly (47.1 %) as shown in Table . Measures We used the Dimensions of Discipline (DD;  to assess punitive and non-punitive parenting behaviors. Our dependent variable is an ordinal variable that corresponds to the use of parenting practices at a given observation period, where 0 = no behaviors listed, 1 = non-punitive parenting behavior used, 2 = punitive parenting behavior used. Each observation period included two punitive and two non-punitive parenting behaviors. The DD has 13 punitive and 13 non-punitive parenting behaviors. Punitive parenting items included those such as 'shout or yell at the child' or 'take away this child's allowance, toys, or other privileges because of misbehavior'. Non-punitive discipline parenting behaviors included 'praise this child for finally stopping bad behavior or for behaving well' and 'show or demonstrate the right thing to do to this child'. These behaviors were randomized into 42 blocks of questions (corresponding to each of the daily observation periods across the 14 days). During 6.5 % of assessments, parents report using punitive parenting techniques while they used non-punitive techniques in 42.9 % of the assessments. These blocks were then randomized for each participant. Table  shows the number of times during each daily observation period each question was asked. Each survey item was asked, on average, 2,056 times (with a range of 1,582 to 2,558). Each item was asked between 517 and 859 times during a particular assessment time. Parents were only asked these questions if they indicated that they had been with their child at any time since the previous survey. For example, in the 9 p.m. survey, that means they were asked to record 'yes' to any of the punitive parenting items they engaged in with the focal child since the 3 p.m. survey, even if they are not with their child at the exact moment they compete the survey (e.g., child is in bed when answering the 9 p.m. survey). Parents reported being home with the focal child in 91.4 % of assessments. Given that the punitive parenting behaviors measured do not meet the threshold for clinical child abuse, no allegations of harm were made to child protective services agencies. One of our primary independent variables was at-the-moment stress asked during each daily observation period. This one-item question asked individuals to rate their stress level on a scale of one to ten. This measure has been shown to be highly correlated (ρ = .682) with the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (American Psychological Association, 2014) and has strong face validity. The average stress level reported by our parents was 3.26 (σ = 2.13). Our second primary independent variable was frequency of alcohol use. The baseline survey asked parents how often they had at least one alcoholic drink in the past twelve months. Responses included 'every day,' 'nearly every day,' 'once or twice a week,' 'about once a month,' 'less than once a month but at least once a year,' 'never during the last twelve months, but had a drink before that,' and 'never had a drink of alcohol in my life.' These were recoded into four mutually exclusive categories: weekly drinkers, monthly drinkers, yearly drinkers, and abstainers. Frequency of drinking, as opposed to drinking volume, has regularly been shown to be related to punitive parenting, such as corporal punishment or physical abuse . Ninety percent of our parents report having at least one alcoholic drink in the past 12 months. This is higher than previous studies of parents . Observation-level control variables included the parent's location when they completed the survey. Although we asked about a variety of locations (e.g., home, store, restaurant, etc.), the majority of the observations occurred at home, likely due to the stay-athome orders. Thus, we recoded the variables where 1 = home and 0 = not at home. We also included the trigger time of day for when the observation was completed (10 a.m., 3 p.m. or 9 p.m.). Individual characteristics used as control variables include biological sex of the parent, marital status of the parent, and parent's education. The latter was recoded to 'some college or less,' 'Bachelor's degree,' and 'graduate degree' given the highly educated nature of the sample. Characteristics of the focal child included biological sex, age, and race/ethnicity (recoded as 'White,' 'African American/ Black,' and 'Other race or ethnicity.' Number of children in the household was also included. Data analysis procedures We conducted one-way ANOVA and chi-square bivariate analyses of the parenting behaviors and the assessment-level variables. We analyzed these data using multilevel models, where 42 at-the-moment assessments (Level 1) were nested within individuals (Level 2). As described above, the observations were measured using ecological momentary analysis. Data on individuals were obtained using an on-line baseline survey. We use multi-level modeling procedures to address intraclass correlations that occur when we nest observations within individuals. Essentially, an individual's behaviors at the various observation points are likely to be similar. This allows us to adjust for those correlations in our models. In our null model, the intraclass correlation was .231. Our outcome was an ordinal variable that depicted use of discipline during the current observation time period. Thus, the outcome had three ordinal categories for each observation: (1) no discipline behaviors; (2) non-punitive discipline; and (3) punitive discipline. We ran five models: (1) observation (Level 1) variables only; (2) observation variables with drinking behaviors at Level 2; (3) all variables in Model 2, with an addition of the alcohol by stress interaction variables; (4) Model 2 variables and the full complement of demographic variables at Level 2; and (5) Model 4 plus the alcohol use by stress interaction variables. Results Bivariate results can be found in Table . Stress was significantly related to use of the three parenting conditions [F(2, 12208) = 202.737, p < .001]. Parents who reported using punitive parenting reported an average level of stress of 4.55 (σ = 2.46) in comparison to those who reported no discipline, m = 3.00 (σ = 1.98), and those who reported non-punitive discipline, m = 3.37 (σ = 2.16). Location of where the survey was completed (home or place other than home) was not related to use of punitive parenting in the bivariate analysis, X 2 (2, N = 12099) = 7.751, p = .417. Time of day when the survey was initiated was significantly related to use of punitive discipline by parents, X 2 (4, N = 12099) = 26.952, p < .001. Specifically, punitive discipline was reported more frequently in the 9:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. assessments as compared to the 10:00 a.m. assessment. Model 1 presents the results of the assessment-level variables only (see Table ). In this model, parents reporting higher levels of stress also report using punitive parenting practices OR = 1.157 (95 % CI = 1.131, 1.183). Punitive parenting behaviors occurred significantly more frequently during the afternoon and evening survey time periods and when they completed the assessment at home (compared to another location). In Model 2, we add our alcohol frequency variables as Level 2 (within individual). Here, monthly drinkers were more likely to use punitive parenting compared to non-drinkers OR = 1.593 (95 % CI = 1.084, 2.342), while the previous assessment-level variables retain significance as in Model 1. Finally, in Model 3, we add our stress * drinking frequency interactions. We find that parents who report drinking monthly OR = 1.109 (95 % CI = 1.010, 1.217) or weekly OR = 1.116 (95 % CI = 1.029, 1.210) have higher odds of reporting using punitive discipline at higher levels of stress, in comparison to abstainers. In the final two models, we add individual-level demographic control variables (see Table ). Model 4, which adds demographic variables to the observation-level variables and drinking frequency, show that married parents had lower odds of using punitive parenting OR = 0.683 (95 % CI = 0.511, 0.914), as did parents of older children OR = 0.905 (95 % CI = 0.877, 0.934). In this model, stress OR = 1.149 (95 % CI = 1.123, 1.176) was positively related to the outcome, with higher stress related to higher odds of use of punitive parenting during an EMA period. In addition, parents had higher odds of reporting use of punitive parenting at the 3:00 p.m. survey OR = 1.230 (95 % CI = 1.123, 1.347) and the 9:00 p.m. survey OR = 1.255 (95 % CI = 1.146, 1.373) in comparison to the 10:00 a.m. survey. The drinking frequency variables were not significant in this model. In Model 5, we add the stress * drinking behavior interactions. Here, we see similar patterns to Model 3, where drinking frequency moderates the association between stress and punitive parenting such that monthly OR = 1.114 (95 % CI = 1.016, 1.222) and weekly drinkers OR = 1.116 (95 % CI = 1.130, 1.209) had higher odds of reporting punitive parenting discipline techniques when reporting higher levels of at-the-moment stress, as compared to abstainers. Figs.  show these interaction effects comparing monthly drinkers to abstainers (Fig. ) and weekly drinkers to abstainers (Fig. ). Discussion Our study is unique in examining associations between stress, alcohol use, and punitive parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic. We extend current literature by investigating whether associations between parental stress and punitive parenting are modified by drinking, and controlled for demographic variables. Our study is consequently well-suited to present initial information about potential areas of intervention for parents experiencing stress due to the worldwide pandemic. Similar to previous studies, higher levels of stress were positively associated with use of punitive parenting . This association was significant even though our sample reported lower average levels of stress than other community samples of non-parents and parents during . However, this study asked individuals to rate their average level of stress in the past month, while our finding represents an average of scores taken across multiple assessments and days and referring to a short time frame (e.g. 6 h). As a result it is unknown whether our lower average stress score is due to lower stress in our sample or measurement differences. In addition, our findings support other preliminary research indicating an association between parental stress and harsh parenting during COVID-19 . Strategies to mitigate stress might be particularly impactful for parents sheltering-in-place with children. Our study was also able to measure associations between time of day and use of parenting. Specifically, afternoon and evening were related to greater odds of punitive parenting versus mornings. It could be that parents and children grow more fatigued during the day, resulting in irritability and a higher chance of negative interactions. As afternoons and evenings could also coincide with when parents are more likely to drink alcohol, these times could represent periods in particular need of intervention. Although frequency of alcohol use was associated with punitive parenting in an initial model, this association was not statistically significant in the presence of demographic covariates. However, we did find that frequency of alcohol use modified the association between stress and punitive parenting. Parents who had greater levels of stress and drank either monthly or weekly had higher odds of punitive parenting than parents with greater levels of stress who abstain from alcohol. This suggests that the presence of alcohol may be an accelerant in the use of punitive parenting for parents experiencing stress. This is particularly worrisome given that research suggests greater alcohol use overall  and by parents  during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study is the first known study during a shelter-in-place order to investigate these associations. Our findings suggest that parents who drink alcohol may be in particular need of supports and stress reduction. This implication is in direct contrast to social media memes which extol alcohol as a solution to COVID-19 related parenting stress (e.g. the Twitter hashtag #covidparenting), and appear to be mimicked by alcohol industry advertisements in Australia . These seemingly light-hearted messages, such as ""mommy needs a drink"" do not take into account the preponderance of evidence that alcohol contributes to negative parenting  ;). In addition, as our research suggests that alcohol use increases risk of punitive parenting during times of stress, messages that encourage alcohol as a parental coping mechanism may further instigate negative effects on children. Limitations Our study has several limitations, the most significant one being our use of a convenience sample that limits generalizability. All of the data used in this study were self-report, and thus potentially biased due to stigma surrounding alcohol use or parenting behaviors. Although our study is a methodological improvement to many in our ability to measure at-the-moment stress and parenting behaviors, our alcohol measures were not measured during the EMA surveys, leaving us without a clear picture of temporal mechanisms between stress, alcohol, and punitive parenting. Our drinking categories of weekly and monthly are broad. A more nuanced measure of alcohol use that includes either a continuous variable related to frequency or measures that combine frequency and quantity might allow us to tease out how stress affects use of punitive parenting. Our measures of punitive parenting included several different parenting behaviors, which may vary in severity. In addition, our study has limited racial and ethnic diversity, are primarily mothers, and highly educated. Although women appear to shouldering much of the burden related to child care, the lack of information from fathers and  from a more diverse sample is a limitation of this study. Finally, our study only includes assessments during the pandemic. These associations might exist outside of stay-at-home pandemic restrictions. Implications & conclusion A large segment of parents may be at higher risk of punitive parenting due to potential greater levels of stress and alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings indicate that parents should be provided with resources that reduce stress and enhance coping, particularly in the afternoon or evening. Our study methodology, which required downloading an app and completing multiple EMA surveys, suggests that parents are able to engage with smartphone-based materials. Smartphone applications could consequently be used as interventions against punitive parenting, and be targeted for times or places where parents are more likely to use punitive parenting. Potential interventions could include mindfulness or breathing reminders, resources for extra support, or education about alcohol use when experiencing stress. Our findings could also be useful to educators, medical providers, and social service agencies who work with families and could screen parents for alcohol use. Finally, larger public education campaigns could be created to counteract the #covidparenting and #winemoms messages that alcohol is a natural and humorous response to parenting stress by informing the public of the potential risks of alcohol use when experiencing stress. These measures could help prevent further punitive parenting in the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as other natural disasters or high stressors in the future. "
35,35,The costs of over-control in anorexia nervosa: evidence from fMRI and ecological momentary assessment,"A growing body of evidence suggests that a high level of self-control may, despite its positive effects, influence cognitive processing in an unfavorable manner. However, the affective costs of self-control have only rarely been investigated. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder that is often characterized by excessive self-control. Here, we used fMRI to explore whether over-control in AN may have negative affective consequences. 36 predominantly adolescent female AN patients and 36 age-matched healthy controls (HC) viewed negative and neutral pictures during two separate fMRI sessions before and after 10 min of rest. We tested whether abnormally elevated neural activity during the initial presentation in a brain region broadly implicated in top-down control, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), could predict subsequent activation in limbic areas relevant to bottom-up affective processing. Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), we also tested for associations between the aforementioned neuroimaging markers and negative affective states in the two weeks following the experiment. fMRI data revealed that higher initial activation of the dlPFC in AN predicted increased amygdala reactivity during the second fMRI session, which in turn was related to increased self-reported tension during two weeks following the scan. These data suggest that overcontrol in AN patients may come at a cost including negative affective states on a short (minutes) as well as a longer time scale (days). This mechanism may significantly contribute to the persistence of AN.",,10.1038/s41398-021-01405-8,"Introduction Self-control, defined as the ""ability to override or change one's inner responses, as well as to interrupt undesired behavioral tendencies""  , is essential for physical health, mental well-being, interpersonal success and academic achievement  . Although generally desirable, self-control may be inherently costly and excessive self-control might be disadvantageous or harmful. Building on the notion that suppressing unwanted thoughts makes them, ironically, more likely to re-occur  and influence behavior  , it has been proposed that self-control is a finite resource that becomes depleted by prior exertion  . After engaging in high levels of self-control (e.g., in attention control or emotion regulation (ER) tasks), participants show poorer performance in subsequent tasks that require control resources, such as response inhibition and error detection  . Neuroimaging studies have helped to understand the mechanisms underlying such costs of control  . In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the decrement of behavioral performance that follows tasks requiring high self-control has been associated with decreased activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)  ; a brain region broadly implicated in higher-order control of behavior, cognitive and affective processing  . In addition to the cognitive costs of exerting control, effects on affective processing (e.g., heightened amygdala reactivity) are welldocumented  . The latter effects are especially relevant because affective processing is a critical prerequisite for psychological well-being that interacts with and modulates cognitive processing  . A small number of fMRI studies have provided evidence suggesting that the exertion of self-control alters processing of aversive emotional stimuli. Wagner and Heatherton  found that participants who performed an attention control task showed both increased amygdala activity and reduced functional connectivity between amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex when subsequently viewing negative emotional scenes. Walter et al.  described heightened amygdala activation as a paradox 'rebound' effect that occurred 2-3 s after the successful downregulation of the amygdala response to negative pictures. Interestingly, the amplitude of this post-regulatory 'rebound' was positively correlated with self-reported habitual thought suppression and amygdala activation in response to the same stimuli when presented again in a passive viewing condition. The costs of control are also apparent when processing primary rewards. In chronic dieters, performing an effortful attention task subsequently led to greater food-cue related activity in a brain region involved in reward processing (orbitofrontal cortex) and was associated with reduced connectivity between this area and inferior frontal regions involved in inhibitory control  . This is in line with the observation that self-imposed inhibition of food intake leads to increased emotional responsiveness, depressive symptoms, and a strong preoccupation with thoughts about food  . In summary, it seems that the excessive or prolonged exertion of self-control may increase the reactivity of brain areas crucial to the processing of aversive and rewarding stimuli, while diminishing the capacity to recruit prefrontal areas involved in top-down control. When studying the costs of (excessive) self-control, anorexia nervosa (AN) may be a disorder that can help to understand general psychological mechanisms  . Perfectionism and an excessive amount of self-control are central elements in theoretical models of AN (e.g., Polivy & Herman 25 , Fairburn et al.  , Haynos & Fruzzetti 27 , Kaye et al.  ). Heightened self-control is closely related to core symptoms of the disorder, such as food restriction and excessive physical activity. It can also explain additional disorder-related behavior (e.g., calorie-counting, endurance of hunger and cold  ) as well as typical but disorderunrelated features (e.g., above average educational achievement  ). It also seems to contribute to the high treatment resistance of patients with AN  . Furthermore, AN patients have been reported to display an increased capacity to delay rewards  and high risk aversion  . As neural correlates of these behavioral patterns, acutely ill and recovered AN patients display an increased involvement of the fronto-parietal control network, especially the dlPFC, across a range of tasks employing disorderrelated  and disorder unrelated stimuli  . Individuals with AN have also been found to show increased functional connectivity in the fronto-parietal control network in the resting state  and during the processing of rewarding  and food stimuli  . There are discrepancies in the literature, however, as some task-based studies have also reported hypo-activation in lateral prefrontal regions in AN (e.g., Steward et al.  ; Holsen et al.  ). To our knowledge, only one study has focused specifically on the costs of over-control in the domain of affective processing in AN. Seidel et al.  reported a stronger volitional down-regulation of the brain reward system in response to positive pictures to be associated with higher body-related rumination, negative affect and tension (assessed in real-life via ecological momentary assessment, EMA) as well as deficient treatment response during follow-up. This may indicate that the tendency toward over-control in AN interferes with psychological well-being and, potentially, recovery. The aim of the current study was to further explore whether increased self-control in AN has costs in the domain of negative affective processing. Using a neuroimaging paradigm comprising two separate sessions recorded before and after 10 minutes of rest, we tested emotional reactivity upon reexposure to previously regulated negative emotional stimuli. We also tested whether neural activity within the control network during the initial presentation of the stimuli predicts subsequent affective processing. Thereby, we built on previous work of our group (Seidel et al.  ), which reported on the first session of the experiment. That study contrasted the passive viewing of neutral and negative (disorder-irrelevant) pictures with the active down-regulation of emotional reactions by means of the reappraisal strategy 'detachment' (for details, see ""Task and procedure"" under ""Methods"" section, and supplementary information (SI) 1.2 and SI 1.4). Emotion regulation contrasts yielded an equally strong downregulation of amygdala activation and self-reported arousal for healthy controls (HC) and young female AN patients. During passive viewing, however, AN patients showed significantly increased activation in the negati-ve>neutral contrast in the left and right dlPFC as well as the right amygdala. In the current study, we extracted parameter values from these dlPFC clusters to predict neural activity linked to affective processing in the second session of the experiment (for details, see ""Prediction analyses"" in ""Methods"" section). In addition to 'costs' at the level of brain activation, we focused on the real-life implications of increased self-control. Using EMA, we tested for associations between the aforementioned neuroimaging markers and negative affect and tension in the two weeks following the experiment. We expected that increased neural activity within the control network, as frequently observed in AN including in our previous study  , would predict increased subsequent reactivity in brain regions pivotal to the processing of negative emotional stimuli, as well as subsequently increased negative affect and tension. Methods Participants fMRI data were collected from 36 young female patients diagnosed with AN and a total of 45 female HC within the same general age range (mean: 16.6, range: 12-29 years). To optimize comparisons between AN and HC, we implemented a pairwise age-matching algorithm (for details, see SI 1.1) that yielded a final sample of n = 36 AN and n = 36 age-matched HC with a mean difference of 0.3 years (maximum: 0.8 years) within case-control pairs. Inclusion criteria for AN included a body mass index (BMI) below 17.5 kg/m 2 (if younger than 15.5 years: below the 10th age percentile) and no recent weight gain. As only three AN participants (8.33%) were of binge-purge subtype, we did not conduct any subtype-specific analyses. HC had to have a body weight of >18.5 kg/m 2 and <28 kg/ m 2 (or > 10th and <94th age percentile, if younger than 18 years), regular menstrual periods, and no history of psychiatric disorder. For all participants, eating-related psychopathology was assessed according to DSM-IV using the Structured Interview for Anorexic and Bulimic Disorders (SIAB-EX)  . Several other exclusion criteria were applied to both groups; most notably, bulimia nervosa or binge eating pathology, psychotropic medication, and neurological or medical conditions that may influence eating behavior or body weight (see SI 1.1). To supplement the information obtained through the SIAB-EX, we assessed eating disorder (ED) specific psychopathology (EDI-2  ), depressive symptoms (BDI-II  ), and anxiety levels (STAI  ). BMI and BMI standard deviation scores corrected for age and gender (BMI-SDS  ) are reported (see Table ). An a priori power analysis was conducted using G*power  . In our previously published study we found group differences in the bilateral dlPFC reactivity during viewing of negative pictures between AN and HC which correspond to an effect size of d = 0.98 and 0.90  . Since we expected the effect size during reexposure to be smaller, we aimed to detect effect of at least d = 0.60, which corresponds to a sample size of n = 36 per group given an alpha-error probability of 5% and a power of 80%. The experimental procedure was approved by the ethics committee of the Technische Universität Dresden, and all participants (or their legal guardians) gave written informed consent. Task and procedure Our analyses included data from three different experimental phases. In phase (1), fMRI during an emotion regulation task (fMRI-ER) was acquired. The resulting data were published in Seidel et al.  and served as predictor variables in the current analyses (for details, see below and SI 1.2, SI 1.4 and SI 2.1). In phase (2), a reexposure fMRI task (fMRI-RX) required participants to passively watch a subset of the pictures previously presented in (1) fMRI-ER, as in Walter et al.  . The two fMRI sessions (phase (1) and ( )) were separated by a 10 minutes break in which structural scans were acquired. Phase (3) covered the 14 days that followed the MRI scan and encompassed EMA of tension and negative affect. Predictor variables from phase (1) fMRI-ER were available for 32 age-matched pairs. The incomplete sample overlap between phase (2) fMRI-RX (our sample) and phase (1) fMRI-ER (Seidel et al.  ) was caused by partial data loss due to technical problems (3 HC) and the resulting need to run a separate age-matching algorithm (exchange of one HC). Data of the subsequent phase (3) EMA were available for all participants except three HC. fMRI Details on phase (1) fMRI-ER were published in Seidel et al.  . In short, the ER task contrasted the passive viewing of neutral and negative pictures (ER_neutral watch and ER_negative watch ) with the active down-regulation of emotional reactions to negative pictures (ER_negative distance ). Participants were instructed to apply the reappraisal strategy 'detachment', which required them to distance themselves from any feelings elicited by the stimuli (for details, see SI 1.2). Pictures were selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS  ) and the emotional pictures set  and did not include any images related to food or body weight (see SI 1.2). Stimulus presentation was pseudorandomized for each participant so that conditions did In accordance with guidelines for brain imaging investigations in eating disorder populations  , we acquired all MRI data between 8 and 9 AM following an overnight fast to control for acute nutritional intake and diurnal hormone rhythms. AN participants were tested within 96 hours after admission to a behaviorally oriented nutritional rehabilitation program. Imaging was carried out with a 3 T whole-body MRI scanner (TRIO; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a standard 12 channel head coil. The functional images were recorded with a gradient-echo T2*-weighted EPI sequence with the following parameters: number of volumes = 210, number of slices = 42, repetition time = 2410 ms. Structural brain scans were acquired with a T1-weighted rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence (number of slices = 176, repetition time = 1900 ms, slice thickness of 1 mm). For more details, see SI 1.2. EMA A comprehensive description of experimental phase (3), EMA data collection, can be found in two previous studies of our group  and in SI 1.3. EMA took place during a period of 14 days following the MRI scan. Participants were prompted to answer an app-based questionnaire via smartphone at six semi-random times per day. At each prompt, current tension and negative affect were assessed with two bipolar items each. The items are part of an adapted version of the Multidimensional Mood Questionnaire (MDMQ  ) recommended for the use in EMA research  . Answers were given on continuous rating scales with opposite anchors (e.g., ""agitated-calm""). Additionally, participants reported their main activity since the last prompt and the company of other people for the purpose of contextual control. Data analysis Reexposure task Arousal ratings Analyses of arousal data and clinical variables were performed in SPSS (Version 25.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Missing arousal ratings were excluded from the analysis (<0.6% in all conditions). A univariate mixed-design ANOVA was conducted with all valid ratings, including the between-subject factor group (AN, HC) and the within-subjects factor condition (RX_neutral, RX_negative). All ANOVA reports in this study encompassed Greenhouse-Geisser corrected F statistics  and partial eta squared (η 2 ) as measures of effect size. Levene's test was used to ensure homogeneity of group variances. MRI Preprocessing The functional data were preprocessed in SPM 8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping software, https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) within the Nipype framework  . Quality of the fMRI data was assessed using visual inspection and artefact detection tools (ART, www. nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect/). Functional images were checked for motion outliers (>2 mm in any direction) and intensity outliers (>3 SD above the mean of the time series). The number of outliers was below 6.2% of all frames for all participants (mean: 1.85%, SD: 1.53%) and did not differ between AN and HC (intensity-outliers: t = 0.219, p = 0.827; motion-outliers: t = 0.692, p = 0.492). Realign4D was used to correct the functional images for head motion and staggered slice acquisition. The algorithm allows for an improved reduction of spatiotemporal distortion by simultaneously accounting for the combination of slice-timing and realignment  . The functional images were first co-registered to the participant's structural T1-image. Subsequently, they were normalized to MNI space by means of a group template created in DARTEL  . The DARTEL template included the structural images of both AN and HC to provide a reference unbiased by potential group differences. Finally, an isotropic Gaussian smoothing kernel with 8-mm fullwidth at half-maximum was applied. MRI Analysis Modeling and analysis of fMRI data from the ER phase are described in Seidel et al.  and SI 1.4. For individual participants' RX data, a general linear model was fit to each voxel's hemodynamic response in the two experimental conditions: (i) RX_neutral (ii) RX_negative. We modeled the presentation of the pictures as a boxcar function with a duration of 1 second and the subsequent rating as a boxcar function of 3 s. Additionally, the six realignment parameters and one regressor for each motion or intensity outlier volume were included as nuisance regressors of no interest. On the level of group analysis, a linear mixed model was estimated using SPM 12. This model included a binary within-subject variable (condition: neutral, negative) and a binary betweensubject variable (group: AN, HC). Contrasts were set up to explore the main effect of group and condition as well as their interaction. We focused on five previously defined brain regions of interest (ROI) that are pivotal in the processing and regulation of (negative) emotional stimuli  : amygdala, insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Information on mask creation is provided in SI 1.4. Additional whole brain analyses are provided in Supplementary Table . Age was included as a covariate in all analyses. Correction for multiple comparisons was accomplished via small volume correction performed in the updated version of 3DClustSim, released June 2017-for details, see SI 1.4. For use in the prediction analyses, mean parameter estimates (beta values) were extracted with MarsBar toolbox for SPM  . Prediction analyses Prediction of RX-MRI data by ER-MRI data In order to investigate whether data of phase (2) fMRI-RX could be predicted by data from the earlier phase (1) fMRI-ER, we conducted a series of regression analyses within the PROCESS toolbox (version 3.0  ) in SPSS (Version 25.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Predictor variables were mean parameter estimates derived from activation in the dlPFC clusters in which we observed a significant group effect (AN > HC) in phase (1) fMRI-ER in response to negative pictures (ER_negative watch > ER_neutral watch , see Seidel et al.  ). The clusters were labeled right dorsal dlPFC, left ventral dlPFC and left dorsal dlPFC (х ̅ ER dlPFC_Ldorsal, х ̅ ERdlPFC_Lventral , х ̅ ER dlPFC_Rdorsal) . To test the regional specificity of the results in a control analysis, the activation of the right amygdala (х ̅ ER amygdala_R ) identified by the same contrast in our previous study (Seidel et al.  ) also served as a predictor. For details about the predictor variables' definition, see SI 1.4 (analyses) and SI 2.1 (results). In addition to activation in these predictor regions, diagnostic group and the interaction between diagnostic group and regional activation served as predictors in each analysis. Outcome variables were parameter estimates extracted from clusters with significant group effects identified by phase (2) fMRI-RX contrasts. Since the fMRI-RX group effects were all condition-unspecific, fMRI outcome as well as fMRI predictor variables were both computed as mean extracted parameter estimates (across all conditions). For all analyses, the assumption of homoscedasticity was confirmed by the Breusch-Pagan test. Prediction of EMA data Since the EMA assessment yielded a nested data structure, we conducted hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to investigate whether data of phase (2) fMRI-RX predicted phase (3) EMA measurements of negative affect and tension 14 days following the scan. Affect and tension served as outcome variables in separate HLM models. The models took into account that the EMA data set was organized in three different levels. Single observations (Level A) were nested within days (Level B) which were nested within participants (Level C). All models allowed for random intercepts and included the following control variables: day of study  on Level B, time (time of the day as a continuous variable from 1 to 6) and the dummy-coded variables of current company and primary activity (chosen from six categories) on Level A. On Level C, we included diagnostic group (coded −1 for HC and 1 for AN), individual parameter estimates of the clusters with a phase (2) fMRI-RX group effect, and their interaction. Results Demographic and clinical variables As shown in Table , AN and HC did not differ with regard to age. As expected, AN had a lower BMI, higher eating disorder (EDI-2), depressive (BDI-II), and anxiety symptoms (STAI-state and STAI-trait) when compared with HC. Reexposure task As expected in this task design, mean arousal ratings during phase (2) fMRI-RX were significantly lower for neutral compared to negative stimuli (F(1, 70) = 358.18, p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.84). There was no significant effect of group (F(1,70)=1.78, p = 0.19, η 2 = 0.03) or interaction between group and condition (F(1, 70) = 0.19, p = 0.66, η 2 = 0.003); for means and standard deviations, see Supplementary Table . Results of the ROI analyses of the phase (2) fMRI-RX data are displayed in Table . Confirming that the RX task worked as expected, viewing negative compared to neutral pictures elicited increased activation in the right amygdala and left insula in both groups. Compared to HC, AN showed increased activation of the right and left amygdala across all conditions. There was no significant interaction between the factors condition and group. In order to ensure that group differences in amygdala activation resulted from core pathology of AN rather than comorbid anxiety symptoms, a separate control analysis included trait anxiety scores (STAI-trait) as a covariate. Group differences remained significant with comparable effect sizes (left amygdala: F(1, 61)=21.33, p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.26; right amygdala: F(1, 61) = 12.77, p = 0.001, η 2 = 0.17). Furthermore, levels of STAI-trait did not correlate significantly with left or right amygdala activation in any of the two groups, which speaks against a confounding influence of trait anxiety symptoms. Prediction analyses Reexposure task As can be seen in Table , phase (1) left dorsal dlPFC activation (х ̅ ER dlPFC_Ldorsal ) as well as phase (1) left ventral dlPFC activation (х ̅ ER dlPFC_Lventral ) differentially predicted phase (2) left amygdala activation (х ̅ RX amygdala_L ) as a function of diagnostic group: in AN, higher levels of phase (1) left dorsal dlPFC and left ventral dlPFC activation (х ̅ ER dlPFC_Ldorsal and х ̅ ER dlPFC_Lventral ) predicted higher levels of phase (2) left amygdala activation (х ̅ RX amygdala_L ). In HC in contrast, higher levels of phase (1) left dorsal dlPFC and left ventral dlPFC activation (х ̅ ER dlPFC_Ldorsal and х ̅ ER dlPFC_Lventral ) predicted lower levels of phase (2) left amygdala activation (х ̅ RX amygdala_L ). For illustration of the moderation effects, see Fig. . Phase (1) activation of the right dorsal dlPFC (х ̅ ER dlPFC_Rdorsal ) did not have a predictive value for phase (2) amygdala activation. Suggestive of an effect specific to brain regions associated with cognitive control, phase (1) activation of the right amygdala (х ̅ ER amygdala_R ) did not have a predictive value for phase (2) amygdala activation (for details, see Table ). EMA data HLM results are displayed in Table  and Supplementary Table  (full model). For use within the HLM, individual fMRI-RX parameter estimates of the significant left and right amygdala clusters were averaged to serve as a single predictor variable at the level of participants (Level C). The momentary level of tension in the two weeks after the fMRI experiment was significantly predicted by group and phase (2) fMRI-RX amygdala reactivity. HC reported generally less tension than AN. Participants with higher fMRI-RX amygdala reactivity reported increased tension compared to those with lower amygdala reactivity. The interaction term was not significant, however, indicating that the size of the amygdala effect did not vary by group. Negative affect was significantly predicted by group, but not phase (2) fMRI-RX amygdala activity, with HC reporting less negative affect than AN. These results were validated by control analyses accounting for potentially confounding effects of compliance with the EMA protocol (see Supplementary Table ). Discussion The aim of the current study was to explore whether over-control in AN, as gauged by increased dlPFC activation, may be associated with costs in the domain of affective processing. Indeed, higher dlPFC activation during emotion processing predicted increased amygdala reactivity at reexposure after a 10 min break in AN, but not HC. Increased amygdala reactivity itself was related to increased self-reported momentary tension in everyday life during two weeks following the scan. As discussed below, these data suggest that over-control in AN may result in negative affective states on a short (minutes) as well as a longer time scale (days), a mechanism that may significantly contribute to the persistence of AN symptomatology. In detail, fMRI data revealed increased reactivity of the bilateral amygdala in AN compared to HC that was present during passive reexposure to previously watched negative and neutral pictures. Increased amygdala activity is a commonly observed neural signature of emotional arousal  . In AN patients, heightened amygdala reactivity has previously been reported in response to disorderrelated  and disorder-unrelated emotional stimuli  . As the observed increase in amygdala activation was not specific to one of the conditions (i.e., present when viewing negative and neutral pictures), we assume that it may reflect a general susceptibility for negative affective states in AN. Quantitative resting state data also support an increased amygdala blood flow in AN  . Capitalizing on the multi-session design of our fMRI paradigm, we showed that amygdala reactivity during reexposure could be predicted by left ventral dlPFC and left dorsal dlPFC activation during the preceding, initial exposure to the stimuli. Importantly, this effect was specific to the dlPFC: a control analysis demonstrated that preceding amygdala activation could not explain amygdala activation at reexposure (see Table ). The direction of this relationship depended upon group. In HC, higher dlPFC activation predicted lower amygdala activation during reexposure; a pattern that is also known from multisession fMRI recordings of successful ER in HC  . In AN,   however, higher dlPFC activation predicted higher subsequent amygdala activation. The dlPFC is considered a crucial brain region of the top-down control network which helps to initiate and adjust control of behavior as well as internal states  . In our data, group-specific dlPFC effects occurred under conditions that did not explicitly require heightened self-control or cognitive control  . Therefore, we suggest that the heightened amygdala reactivity in AN may be a cost of implicit control mechanisms that are activated automatically, or a cost of a heightened baseline level of sustained cognitive control  . Our results extend previous findings of increased fronto-parietal control network activation in AN employing disorder-related and unrelated stimuli  . They are in line with the proposition that the increased control network activity in AN is partly independent of task and stimulus type, as also reflected in resting state fMRI data  . However, it is also important to consider the heterogeneous nature of previous dlPFC findings from voluntary ER experiments in AN. While Seidel et al.  reported dlPFC hyper-activation in AN, Steward et al.  described dlPFC hypo-activation. The apparently discrepant findings of these studies are difficult to compare, however, because of noteworthy differences including age, task design and analysis (event-vs. block-related), satiation, the timepoint of scanning in relation to treatment begin; all of which are generally important factors to consider when interpreting neuroimaging results in ED studies  . Ironically, our fMRI data suggest that 'preventive over-control' may backfire, making states of increased arousal more likely to occur. This is supported by our EMA measurements which, like previous findings 79 , indicate higher self-reported momentary tension in AN. We found that EMA ratings could be predicted by amygdala reactivity during reexposure. Controlling for a large number of context variables (such as current activity and the company of others), these findings establish a link between neural activity in a controlled laboratory task and disorder-relevant affective states in real-life situations over the fairly long time course of two weeks. Evidence that over-control may come at a cost such as increased tension in everyday life is in line with EMA data showing that highly restrictive eating coincides with higher tension, anxiety and negative affect measured throughout the day  . These results offer an insightful perspective on the clinical presentation of AN. Several theoretical models of AN etiology include heightened tension and highly controlled behavior as core features  . However, these models state that overcontrolled behavior (e.g., dietary restriction) reduces tension  , presumably serving as an alternative, maladaptive strategy of ER  . In accordance with Haynos et al.  , our results question the effectiveness of overcontrol (including emotional avoidance) as an ER strategy and suggest that while over-controlled behavior may be experienced as a helpful way to reduce tension in the short term, it may in fact increase tension in the long run. This possibility is supported by data on the downregulation of positive emotions, which has been shown to predict higher body-related rumination and increased negative affect in AN  . In other studies, higher daily levels of negative affect in AN predicted increased rumination  and increased dietary restriction on the following day  . In light of these findings, it seems plausible that negative affective states and a tendency towards over-controlled behavior form a selfperpetuating circle that impedes the reduction of dysfunctional behavior in AN and prevents long-term improvement of mood. From a methodological point of view, our findings emphasize the importance of precisely defining time scales (e.g., short-term versus long-term regulation) when investigating ER in eating disorders. As also pointed out by Engel et al.  , temporal parameters of analytic approaches could account for some of the previous inconsistencies in ER studies on AN. From a conceptual point of view, our findings also highlight complexities in the definition of self-control  . While self-control is often viewed as a limited resource that costs effort 5 , others describe it as a dynamic process of resolving goal conflict, e.g., between have to and want to goals or short-and long-term goals  . From this perspective, restrictive eating in AN can be viewed as a consequence of the conflict between hedonic eating and weight control being resolved by heightened accessibility of long-term (weight-related) goals-an implicit process which might enable AN patients to control themselves even in very tempting situations  . Thus, self-control may be 'second nature' for many individuals with AN. Similarly, constant down-regulation of emotions may emerge from the goal conflict between acting out and down-regulating emotions being implicitly resolved by self-restraint. In the context of goal conflict theories, these behavioral tendencies in AN may be seen as maladaptive because they fail to establish a balance between different types of goals. This predominance of weight/emotion control goals has severe long-term physical and emotional consequences  . Similar costs of over-control have also been observed in healthy individuals who showed increased amygdala reactivity in response to emotional stimuli after performing a demanding attention control task  . Amygdala reactivity also seems to be amplified in healthy participants who habitually use emotion suppression  . Furthermore, control strategies such as thought suppression have been shown to aggravate the desire to overeat in normal-weight and overweight restrained eaters  and worsen clinical symptoms in patients with bulimia nervosa (BN)  . In the latter two groups, phases of dietary restriction alternate with loss of control and food binging, an effect that seems to be reinforced by negative emotions  . Although only 8.33% of the AN patients in the current study were of the binge-purge subtype, it is possible that the different aforementioned expressions of costs of over-control are grounded in similar interactions between amygdala and dlPFC as observed in our AN sample. This possibility should be addressed by future studies. The results of our study have to be considered in the light of the following limitations. Amygdala reactivity predicted EMA measures of momentary tension, but not negative affect. Possible explanations are a stronger involvement of the amygdala in the processing of tension and arousal compared to affective valence  , and potentially biasing effects of social desirability or alexithymia  on the valence ratings of AN patients. Another variable that might have had undue influence on our results is the fairly broad age range of the sample (12-29 years). Despite our strict, pair-wise age-matching and the inclusion of age as a covariate in all analyses, an influence of (neuro-) developmental factors cannot be excluded. During adolescence, the dlPFC undergoes a critical phase of cortical maturation and thinning  , which has been associated with changes in the use of cognitive control and ER  . These processes, as well as detrimental effects of chronification with longer durations of illness, might lead to different results in an older AN sample. Additionally, it remains unclear to what extent altered amygdala activation is caused by the state of undernutrition in AN patients  . Since it has been suggested that abnormalities in amygdala reactivity might persists beyond recovery of AN  , similar studies in weightrecovered, former patients might help to disentangle state and trait factors. Our data extend the hypothesis of sustained and elevated self-control in AN  by providing insight into the costs of over-control. They suggest that heightened activity of control-related brain regions is associated with increased negative affective processing, supporting the notion that AN may be characterized by an altered balance between ventral limbic and dorsal executive networks  . Over-controlled behavior and negative affective states may reinforce each other  , a mechanism that could contribute to the maintenance of AN symptoms. From a clinical perspective, these results lend support to therapeutic approaches that enable AN patients to better allocate the use of self-control. Helpful techniques may for instance be derived from the ""radically opendialectical behavior therapy"", which specifically targets overly controlled behavior and has been successfully tested in the treatment of AN  . Moreover, therapeutic approaches that are based on mindfulness and emotional acceptance may tip the balance between hedonistic, acceptance-based processing and depleting, control-based strategies in a favorable manner  . In the treatment of severe enduring AN, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left dlPFC has been associated with improvements in ED symptoms, including a reduction of self-controlled food choice and affective symptoms  , which were maintained at an 18 month follow-up  . Taken together, our results provide evidence in support of these therapeutic approaches and may stimulate further research into interventions that modulate the balance between affective and executive control networks.

36,36,The Error-Related Negativity Predicts Self-Control Failures in Daily Life,"Adaptive behavior critically depends on performance monitoring (PM), the ability to monitor action outcomes and the need to adapt behavior. PM-related brain activity has been linked to guiding decisions about whether action adaptation is warranted. The present study examined whether PM-related brain activity in a flanker task, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), was associated with adaptive behavior in daily life. Specifically, we were interested in the employment of self-control, operationalized as self-control failures (SCFs), and measured using ecological momentary assessment. Analyses were conducted using an adaptive elastic net regression to predict SCFs from EEG in a sample of 131 participants. The model was fit using within-subject averaged response-locked EEG activity at each electrode and time point within an epoch surrounding the response. We found that higher amplitudes of the error-related negativity (ERN) were related to fewer SCFs. This suggests that lower error-related activity may relate to lower recruitment of interventive self-control in daily life. Altered cognitive control processes, like PM, have been proposed as underlying mechanisms for various mental disorders.

Altered neural correlates of PM in various mental disorders associated with deficient goal-directed control, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and substance use disorders , indicate a link between neural measures of PM and regulatory control in daily life . Accordingly, self-control in daily life, as assessed via smartphone-based ecological momentary assessments (EMA), has been linked to error-related activity in the PM network in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study . The aim of the current study was to establish whether PM-related brain activity as measured by the errorrelated negativity (ERN) predicts adaptive behavior in daily life. Given that to date most studies assessed self-control in daily life using self-report questionnaires, data on actual behavior outside the lab and the link to brain activity is still rare . There are many models and theories on self-regulation, which focus on different levels of analysis, and which have not yet been integrated within an overarching framework . Self-regulation is the process of ascertaining a desired goal and then taking action to move toward that goal and continuously monitoring progress and the need to adapt the behavior . Self-regulation includes various steps, like deciding on a goal, planning how to pursue it, pursuing it, and shielding that goal from interference or competing responses . Goaldirected behavior is thus behavior that is being performed based on the belief that a specific goal or outcome can be achieved by this behavior, and that there is a reason to seek that specific outcome . Self-control constitutes one specific form of self-regulation, but not all forms of self-regulation include self-control .  define self-control as targeting behavior toward a desired goal, a process which includes inhibitory as well as initiatory components and is closely connected to the implementation of behavior . Self-control can therefore be described as the ability to change or override competing response tendencies as well as to regulate behavior, thoughts and emotions in accordance with a desired goal, and is exerted to promote desirable responses and inhibit undesirable responses or impulsive actions . Self-regulation is a broader concept, which includes goal setting, monitoring if there is a need for the exertion of self-regulation, and implementing actions according to set goals . A related concept is cognitive control, which can be described as the ability to pursue goal-directed behavior, opposing otherwise more habitual or immediately compelling behaviors . There are differing opinions on how exactly cognitive control, which in core aspects strongly resembles the concept of self-regulation, relates to self-regulation. Cognitive control is typically used as a term for employment of cognitive operations or executive functions, like inhibition, attentional shifting and working-memory updating, whereas self-regulation typically refers to adapting behavior in daily life . The broad monitoring function described in the self-regulation literature is similar to the aforementioned concept of PM . PM-related brain activity has repeatedly been linked to guiding the decision about whether and which action adaptation is warranted . PM can be described as a set of continuously operating cognitive and affective functions that determine whether adaptive control is required and therefore provide the basis for successful goal-directed behavior . At a neural level, PM functions appear to be implemented by a PM network that comprises the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), the presupplementary area (pre-SMA) and the adjacent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and is connected to the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) . There is evidence, however, that the preSMA is more involved in inhibitory mechanisms and not conflict processing per se . Necessity, type and magnitude of adaptation are associated with signal changes in the pMFC . Various theories of PM exist, mainly differing with respect to the presumed information-processing mechanism generating the adaptation signal. While some theories assume that adaptation is employed based on a weighted prediction error signal , others focus on the occurrence of information-processing conflicts and their detection by certain brain regions (mainly the aMCC), and propose that conflict signals serve as one aspect of a more general outcome monitoring function, which triggers strategic adjustment of cognitive control . The ERN is a defined event-related potential (ERP) that is associated with PM at the response processing stage of goaldirected behavior . The ERN is an early frontocentral negativity which occurs on error trials peaking 50-100 ms after the response, and has been shown to be independent of stimulus and response effector modality . The ERN amplitude also appears to be influenced by subjective error significance , and its source is assumed to be mainly localized within the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) . The correct-related negativity (CRN) is a similar component that is observed following correct responses, but is reduced in amplitude . During response processing, errors can be detected immediately when task rules are known . The ERN may therefore reflect fast alarm signals indicating the need to adapt behavior . The ERN amplitude has been shown to predict subsequent neural as well as within-task behavioral adjustments. This has been posited as evidence for the monitoring activity of the aMCC playing an important role in the employment of cognitive control or self-control . Evidence for this also arises from findings regarding altered PM correlates in mental disorders associated with deficient goal-directed control, such as OCD and SUD, which indicate a connection between neural measures of PM and regulatory control in daily life . Stable individual differences in the ERN magnitude are considered a trait indicator for the disposition to recruit the control network and show adequate re-test reliability . Impaired self-control can be described as a deficient implementation of cognitive control-some models of self-control posit a balance between top-down control (as implemented by the prefrontal cortex) and subcortically mediated impulsive reactions to emotional stimuli or appetitive cues . These self-control failures (SCFs) can result from both underregulation and misregulation. Whereas, underregulation is a failure to exert self-control, misregulation entails the exertion of self-control, but in a misguided or counterproductive way . These connections are usually assessed via task performance or by using self-report questionnaires . However, there is data on links between PM and actual behavior outside the lab: In a study focused on emotion regulation, ERN difference scores also predicted the strength of the associations between daily stress and anxiety . Apart from error-related activity, higher inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) activity on correct trials of a go/no-go task has been connected to higher resistance to food-related temptations in daily life . One study also more directly examined this association: Error-related activity inside the PM network in an fMRI study has been linked to self-control in daily life, as assessed by EMA. A higher amount of SCFs was associated with low errorrelated activation of the PM network involving aMCC, preSMA and anterior Insula, as well as low post-error IFG activation and less post-error slowing . The aim of the present study was to establish whether PMrelated brain activity as indicated by the ERN predicts adaptive behavior in daily life, following the brain-as-predictor approach . We specifically were interested in the employment of self-control in real-life situations involving conflicts between transient desires and superordinate or longterm goals. To this end, PM-related brain activity was assessed using electroencephalography (EEG) in an adapted version of the Eriksen flanker task . Selfcontrol in daily life was measured utilizing EMA following procedures described by . We expected the ERN amplitude, as a measure of PM-related brain activity, to predict the amount of SCFs in daily life. Based on  we expected that lower amplitudes of the ERN, indicating attenuated error monitoring leading to a reduced behavioral adaptation and mobilization of cognitive control -should relate to higher propensity to commit SCFs in daily life. METHODS Sample One hundred and forty participants were recruited from the general population in the Dresden area. Seven participants made more than 40% errors across all trials, one had a significant number of random button presses, and another had discontinued the assessment. They were therefore excluded from further analyses. The final sample consisted of 131 participants (58.8% female; M = 25.86 years, SD = 5.65), 121 participants (92.4%) had completed advanced education degrees, 9% reported past mental health problems. 95.4% of participants self-identified as of mainly European, 4.6% as of mainly Asian ancestry. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, were native speakers of German, and reported no history of head trauma or neurological disease. Participants were further not included if they reported taking psychotropic substances within the past 3 months; reported a history of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, psychotic episodes, or severe alcohol use disorder; currently met the criteria for an eating disorder or severe episode of major depression; reported a lifetime use of illicit substances of more than twice a year and lifetime use of cannabis of more than twice a month. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethics committee at the University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universität Dresden approved study procedures (EK 372092017). All participants gave informed consent. Procedure, Measures, and Tasks Procedure Participants completed two sessions in the lab, and between those sessions a week of EMA of self-control in daily life. Questionnaire data were obtained during the first session, at the end of which participants received a smartphone for EMA and completed a short EMA tutorial. The tutorial comprised answering the EMA questionnaire regarding five fictive situations and participants could ask questions and received feedback. PM-related brain activity was assessed using the ERN during a flanker task using EEG during the second session. We also assessed correctrelated activity in incongruent trials, as well as the difference between error-and correct-related activity in incongruent trials, to distinguish between error-sensitive and outcome-independent aspects of response monitoring . The EEG session took place at least 8 days after the first session. During both sessions, participants completed other tasks, which are not part of this report. Ecological Momentary Assessment We assessed self-control in daily life using EMA during a seven-day period similar to  and , assessing the occurrence of desires, how strong they were, if these desires were conflict-laden, how strong the conflict was, if participants tried to resist the desire and if they enacted the desire. Up to four dichotomous variables (desire, conflict, resistance, and enactment), one categorical variable (desire type), and two continuous variables (desire and conflict strength) were acquired per questionnaire. Participants were instructed to carry the devices with them at all times during the assessment window. Depending on response rates, participants completed up to 56 questionnaires. SCFs were operationalized as enactments of conflict-laden desires divided by the number of questionnaires participants had responded to. Self-control is required when one experiences a desire that conflicts with a long-term goal or a personal standard . Participants received eight short questionnaires throughout the day, delivered within a 14 h time window, which was chosen based on participant's usual waking hours (starting at either 8, 9, or 10 a.m.). The time points were randomized, but at least 1 h apart and signaled by an alarm. Alarms could be manually deferred by participants, for a maximum of 15 min. Participants received identical smartphones (Nokia 5). A customizable EMA application delivered the questionnaires, all other functions were blocked (movisensXS, version 1.3.3; movisens GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). See Supplementary Figure  for a schematic depiction of a questionnaire. Internal consistency of SCFs was acceptable, determined as the Spearman-Brown corrected split-half reliability, using the odd-even method (0.77). Flanker Task Participants performed a modified version of the arrow-version of the Eriksen flanker task . The flanker stimuli consisted of four vertically arranged arrows pointing to the left or the right. A fifth arrow appeared as target stimulus with a delay of 100 ms, in addition to the surrounding flanker arrows. All arrows remained on screen for 30 ms. In 50% of the trials, the target stimulus pointed in the same direction (congruent) as the surrounding arrows. In the other 50% of the trials, the target pointed in the opposite direction (incongruent). Participants had to respond using a left or right button, according to the direction of the target arrow. The task was presented in two incentive contexts which were cued as follows: Each trial started with an incentive cue, a green or red frame surrounding a fixation cross, signaling potential gain (green) or loss (red) of 40 points in the current trial (presented for 500 ms). The frame remained visible for the duration of the trial. In the gain condition (50% of all trials), the fastest 20% of the correct responses were rewarded (40 points) while errors resulted in reward omission (0 points). In the loss avoidance condition, incorrect and the slowest responses were punished (minus 40 points), and correct responses resulted in punishment omission. Slowest responses were defined by an adaptive deadline based on individual performance and response time, in order to obtain a rate of 20 % negative feedback for each context. Performance feedback was presented for 800 ms after a response interval of 900 ms following target onset or 600 ms after response. The deadline was initially set at 500 ms, and was adapted based on the rate of negative feedback. If the rate of negative feedback was higher than 20%, 30 ms were added to the adaptive deadline, if the rate was below 20%, 30 ms were subtracted from the deadline. The two incentive contexts were introduced to the task for a different research question than the one addressed here. However, associations with SCF were examined separately for the two incentive contexts, and reported as supplementary results. Associations were significant in both contexts and exhibited similar effect sizes. Participants could earn a bonus of up to 5 EUR, depending on task performance and points earned. They received 4 EUR if they earned less than 5,000 points, 4,50 EUR for 5,001 to 5,500 points, and 5 EUR for more than 5,501 points. The task included 640 trials of 2.53 to 2.75 s duration. The task was presented using Presentation 19.0 (Neurobehavioral Systems Inc., Berkeley, CA, USA). See Figure  for a schematic depiction of the task. Psychophysiological Recording and Data Reduction The EEG was continuously recorded at a sampling rate of 500 Hz using elastic EEG caps with 63 Ag/AgCl electrodes at equidistant locations (EasyCap GmbH, Herrsching-Breitbrunn, Germany) and two 32-channel BrainAmp amplifiers (Brain Products GmbH, Munich, Germany). Impedances were kept below 10 kOhm. Two external electrodes placed below the left FIGURE 1 | Schematic depiction of the flanker task. Participants were instructed to respond with the left or right button according to the direction of the middle arrow. In the gain context, the fastest 20% of the correct response were rewarded (1a), in the loss avoidance context incorrect and slowest responses were punished (2b). The other responses were neither punished nor rewarded (1b, 2a). and right eye were used to capture eye movement. Ground and reference electrodes were placed next to Fz (at AFF1h and AFF2h, theta/phi spherical coordinates:−58/78 and 58/78). Offline analyses were performed using EEGLAB 14.1.2 ) and MATLAB 2018b (The MathWorks Inc., 2018). The EEG was high-and low-pass filtered with cutoffs of 0.1 and 30 Hz, respectively, and epoched from −500 to 2,000 ms relative to target stimulus onset. Epochs with artifacts were rejected automatically based on signal deviations >5 SD of the mean probability distribution on any single channel or the whole montage. Remaining epochs were demeaned and submitted to adaptive mixture independent component analysis (AMICA) implemented in EEGLAB. Independent components reflecting ocular or cardiovascular artifacts were removed manually and EEG data were re-referenced to common average reference. Subsequently, response-locked epochs from −500 to 1,000 ms were created. The average EEG activity 400 to 200 ms prior to response was used as baseline. Individual participant's mean amplitudes per trial type were calculated for each time point and electrode within the extracted epochs. Internal consistency of EEG measures was excellent, determined as the Spearman-Brown corrected split-half reliability (odd-even method) for error and correct amplitudes (0.92, 0.98), respectively, averaged for FCz, Fz, F1, and F2 in a time window of 20 ms around the individual peak. Data Analysis An adaptive elastic net regularized (aenet) regression based on the Poisson distribution was fit to predict SCFs from responselocked EEG . The model was run using within-subject averaged response-locked EEG activity of incongruent error trials. Two additional models were run: one using difference scores of the within-subject averaged response-locked EEG for incongruent error minus incongruent correct trials and one using the withinsubject averaged response-locked EEG for incongruent correct trials. The aenet regression selects the variables relevant for the prediction of an outcome from an ultra-high dimensional dataset, a dataset in which the number of predictors outnumber the amount of observations, by setting the coefficients of nonrelevant features to zero . However, it also allows the grouped selection of correlated features, which is highly relevant when dealing with EEG data . We also chose the aenet regression because in the analysis of ultra-high dimensional data, a method should have oracle properties in addition to yielding sparse models, meaning that it consistently identifies the right subset model and has an optimal estimation rate . The predictors, or features, in this case were the EEG signals at each electrode and time point. Epochs were selected so that they would contain relevant time points for response-processing but also reduce the amount of features, so that estimation would be more reliable . We chose an epoch from 50 ms prior to the response to 300 ms after the response. A central cluster of 23 electrodes was also chosen for relevance in response processing (including Cz, FCz, FC2, CP2, CPz, CP1, FC1, Fz, F2, FC4, C4, CP4, P2, Pz, P1, CP3, C3, FC3, F1, PO4, PO2, PO1, PO3). This resulted in 4,025 data points (23 electrodes × 175 time points). In order to be able to compute accurate estimates within a relatively small sample, we tuned the alpha and lambda hyperparameters using 5-fold cross validation with 10 repeats within an elastic net regression. We used the rootmean-square error (RMSE) as the metric for optimization. Then, the adaptive penalty factors were estimated using the estimated beta values from the first model with the best tuning results. Using these adaptive penalty factors, the aenet regression was tuned using 5-fold cross validation with 10 repeats. Finally, an aenet regression using the final aenet model hyperparameters was internally validated using 0.632 bootstrapping , with 1,000 bootstrap samples. We chose bootstrapping for internal validation over external cross validation using training and test data, because in smaller datasets this has been shown to reduce bias and improve model performance . We then estimated the importance of predictors in the model using the absolute values of the coefficients corresponding to the tuned model. Variable importance represents the effect of an predictor on the output of a model when inputs are varied . In addition, generalized linear models (GLMs) based on negative binomial distribution were built to predict SCFs from mean ERN amplitude in a time window of 20 ms around the individual ERN peak, averaged for FCz, Fz, F1, and F2, as well as from behavioral measures. See the supplement for GLMs predicting SCFs from difference scores and the mean CRN amplitude, also based on a time window around the individual peak. Because the behavioral data were not normally distributed, we analyzed differences between behavioral measures using a bootstrapped version of Yuen's test. The difference between incongruent error trials and incongruent correct trials was tested for each time point within an epoch from 50 ms prior to the response to 300 ms after the response in electrodes Fz and FCz, using dependent sample t-tests with Bonferroni-corrected alpha. Statistical analysis of EEG and behavioral data was performed in R 4.0.0 (R Core Team, 2020) using the packages glmnet v4.0, msaenet v3.1, caret v6.0-86, MASS v7.3-51.5, and WRS2 v1.0-0  and MATLAB 2018b (The MathWorks Inc., 2018). RESULTS Behavioral Results Ecological Momentary Assessment On average, participants responded to 48.52 (SD = 7.59, MD = 51) of the 56 issued alarms (86.64 %). In 70.19% of answered alarms participants reported desires, 38.22% of desires were conflict-laden, and of those 56.60% were enacted. See Table  and Supplementary Figure  for further results. Flanker Task Average error rate was 16.75% (SD = 8.22%). The propensity for committing an error was significantly reduced on posterror trials compared to post-correct trials, Y t = 0.04 (95% CI: 0.02 0.05), p < 0.001, providing evidence of improved   13.99), p < 0.001. Trials in the loss avoidance condition had slightly longer RT, compared to the gain condition (all p < 0.05), but this was not the case on incongruent correct trials. We did not find evidence of post-error slowing, when comparing RT of post-error and post-correct incongruent trials, Y t = 0.07, p = 0.93. Behavioral results are also presented in Table . Associations Between Behavioral Measures and SCFs There was no significant association between SCFs and posterror slowing (p = 0.61), operationalized as the RT difference between post-error and post-correct incongruent trials, error rate (p = 0.15), post-error accuracy (p = 0.17), post-correct accuracy (p = 0.17), and the interference effect (p = 0.64), operationalized as the RT difference between incongruent and congruent correct trials. Internal consistency of PES and the interference effect (0.67, 0.94), respectively, was determined as the Spearman-Brown corrected split-half reliability, using the odd-even method.  EEG Analysis The ERN peaked at 48 ms at electrode FCz, and at 46 ms at Fz (local minimum of grand average). Peak electrode was FCz. The difference between error trials and correct trials following the response was significant between 0 and 104 ms at FCz (all p < 0.0001), and 28 and 110 ms for Fz (all p < 0.0001). Averaged response-locked EEG epochs for incongruent error trials were submitted to aenet regression analysis with SCFs as outcome; EEG signals at each electrode and time point served as predictors [final model: α = 0.75, λ = 0.0273, RMSE = 2.05, R 2 = 0.04, mean absolute error (MAE) = 2.04]. This analysis revealed four variables of importance with predictive value for SCFs (see Table ). All of these coefficients corresponded to fronto-central electrode Fz and time points associated with the ERN in the averaged event-related potentials. Therefore, the ERN amplitude of error trials in a flanker task significantly predicted the amount of SCFs at a frontal electrode site. Higher, or more negative, ERN amplitudes predicted less SCFs and mean amplitude of the ERN was reduced in individuals reporting a higher number of SCFs. See Figure  for a visualization of ERP waveform and scalp distribution for the ERN and Figure  for visualization of the association. Additionally, difference scores of the averaged response-locked EEG epochs for incongruent error minus incongruent correct trials were also submitted to aenet regression analysis with SCFs as outcome (final model: α = 0.75, λ = 0.0213, RMSE = 2.05, R 2 = 0.03, MAE = 2.04). Variables of importance corresponded to fronto-central electrodes and timepoints associated with the ERN (see Table ). Lastly, averaged response-locked EEG epochs for incongruent correct trials were submitted to aenet regression analysis with SCFs as outcome (final model: α = 0.75, λ = 0.0208, RMSE = 2.05, R 2 = 0.03, MAE = 2.04). All variables of importance corresponded to posterioroccipital electrode PO1 and time-points prior to the response (see Table ). Therefore, we found no evidence that the CRN amplitude, unlike the ERN, predicted the amount of SCFs and the effect was specific for error-related activity. Individual peak ERN amplitude at electrodes FCz, Fz, F1, and F2 also predicted SCFs within a GLM based on negative binomial distribution (β = 0.058, z = 2.097, p < 0.05).  DISCUSSION The present study investigated the association between neural correlates of PM in a flanker task and self-control in daily life as measured by EMA. Results showed that higher ERN amplitudes predicted fewer SCFs, indicating higher self-control in daily life. Results therefore support an association between labbased assessment of neural correlates of PM and self-control in daily life, as our analysis revealed four variables of importance corresponding to the ERN time window in an analysis that included 23 electrodes and all time points from 50 ms before until 300 after the response. In addition, this association was also shown by a regression with the mean amplitude for the ERN at frontocentral electrodes in a time window around the individual peak. The association was also observed for the difference between error-and correct-related activity, but no relationship between SCFs and CRN was observed. As adaptive, goal-directed behavior depends on monitoring for the need to adapt behavior, and ERN amplitudes have been interpreted as reflecting the detection of errors or unexpected action outcomes, indicating the need to adapt , a connection between PM and selfcontrol seems plausible. This connection has been established before, using fMRI . However, despite PM being necessary for appropriate recruitment of control, it is not sufficient, as additional brain regions have to respond to these signals for adaptive control to be implemented . This might also account for the small size of the effect within our sample. Overall, our results fit well into the literature on selfregulation and self-control ). PM appears FIGURE 2 | Time course of response-locked EEG activity at electrodes FCz and Fz, and scalp distribution of response-locked EEG activity as well as difference in EEG activity between high and low number of self-control failures. Grand average event-related potential (ERP) waveforms are depicted on the left, response-locked for incongruent error trials.

Shadows indicate the SEM.

Whereas interventive self-control refers to inhibition of immediate impulses, preventive self-control includes initiating desired, goal-directed behavior as well as preventing encounters with situations, which may elicit temptations . A related concept from cognitive neuroscience is the distinction between preparatory and corrective control  or the distinction between proactive and reactive control . SCFs as assessed in this study probably fall in the categories of motivational and volitional SCFs, as the preceding desire and conflict are reported and self-monitoring was therefore successful. An influence of motivation on how successfully individuals exert self-control has frequently been reported . Having low motivation for self-control might result in fewer reported conflict-laden desires, and thus, SCFs. At the same time, individuals with higher motivation might report more conflict-laden desires, while at the same time also trying to avoid situations in which they might encounter a desire. However, individuals high in self-control have been reported to experience desires less frequently . This could indicate that individuals higher in self-control may avoid situations in which they might be tempted because of a high subjective significance of not failing at the implementation of selfset goals, and subsequently experience less desires. This would also fit well with the reported modulations of the ERN amplitude by subjective error significance : Individuals high in self-control may attach great importance to sticking to their goals and performing well, which is consequently reflected in higher error-related brain activity as indicated by the ERN. Higher ERN amplitudes predicting less SCFs therefore presents as an intuitive connection at first. Individuals with higher ERN amplitudes appear to possess a more effective monitoring system to signal a higher need for the employment of cognitive control when needed, while at the same time attaching more significance to errors, resulting in better selfcontrol . The ERN has been shown to have high re-test reliability, and changes in ERN amplitude have been observed in psychopathology . But when thinking about individuals with OCD, who display impaired selfcontrol in daily life despite consistent evidence on higher ERN amplitudes , questions about how our findings relate to enhanced ERN in individuals with OCD do arise. Larger ERN amplitudes in OCD appear to be unrelated to performance or adjustment of behavior within-task, such as post-error slowing. This could suggest deficient translation of monitoring signals into adaptive behavior and therefore a failure to implement control . Another explanation, which might fit with clinical representations of OCD, might be misguided self-control: such that in OCD self-control is applied in an inadequate or counterproductive manner (such as washing hands 50 times a day to prevent infection transforms a usually adaptive behaviorhand washing-into a self-control problem, presenting as excessive behavior) . The concept of self-control could therefore also be discussed in terms of how much and what kind of self-control is ""healthy, "" and what kind of behavior is excessive, misguided and costly . Other disorders, more on the externalizing spectrum, like SUD or pathological gambling, might fit more with the framework of underregulation, as those disorders appear to reflect a failure to exert self-control when needed . Consistent with our present findings, externalizing disorders (including a general aggressive disposition) have been associated with lower ERN amplitudes . Our finding that a reduced ERN predicts a higher frequency of SCFs is fully consistent with  result that reduced activation the PM network as assessed with fMRI predicts a higher propensity to commit SCFs. However, results are less consistent with respect to error rates and interference effects. While  did find evidence for an association between error rates, post-error slowing, and SCFs, this was not the case in our study. One possible explanation for this discrepancy may reside in the different tasks used in our and the  study (flanker versus counting Stroop, respectively). Within-task adjustments of behavior, reflecting enhanced goal-directed control, have been associated with higher aMCC activity on high-conflict and error trials . Implementation of these behavioral adjustments, however, seems to be mediated by lateral PFC regions, and aMCC engagement has been proposed to reflect signaling for an enhanced recruitment of top-down control . However, whether behavioral adaptation effects in such tasks actually reflect control adjustments or whether they can be accounted for by non-control related processes has been questioned . Consequently, there have been demands for analysis of other measures of control implementation, such as ecologically more valid assessment of self-control via EMA . Also, the current version of the flanker task including feedback shortly after every response, even punishing correct responses when they were too slow and thereby giving false external feedback, might hinder the emergence of post-error slowing . In addition, the reliability (0.67) of our post-errors slowing measure (as RT difference) was insufficient [see also ]. It therefore remains a question for future research, whether the connection between neural correlates of PM and control recruitment may be more valid predictors of self-control in daily life than behavioral adjustments in laboratory tasks. In addition, current findings should be replicated using a standard flanker task (without task contexts and feedbacks). However, irrespective of these unresolved issues, the present results add to a growing body of evidence documenting associations between neural indicators of monitoring and control processes with ecologically valid assessments of real-life self-control via EMA. How neural correlates of PM relate to regulatory control in daily life is central to our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying goal-directed behavior. Other aspects of the connection uncovered in the current study have to be examined in future studies. SCFs reported by participants of the present study most likely represent instances, in which interventive self-control would be required to resist current temptations and to support the pursuit of long-term goals. However, the number of SCFs might also partly reflect individual differences in the use of preventive self-control strategies (e.g., pre-commitment), which might help to avoid temptations and self-control conflicts and thus result in fewer reported desires and conflicts. Whether PM differentially influences interventive and preventive self-control remains an interesting but unresolved question . As mentioned above, it would also be of interest to examine the connection between PM and the actual neural implementation of self-control and how that in turn relates to goal-directed behavior in daily life. It has been suggested that the exertion of self-control is implemented via the top-down-modulation of task-relevant perceptual representations in conflict tasks (e.g., the Stroop task)  and of value representations in choice conflict tasks  by goal representations maintained in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, such top-down modulations have been shown to predict real-life self-control. Thus, bridging the gap between PM and the implementation of self-control in laboratory tasks, and assessments of goaldirected behavior in daily life will be particularly important for understanding mechanisms underlying deficient or misguided self-control in various mental disorders. Moreover, it could also help to understand how to effectively implement public policies aiming at a reduction of harmful behavior and SCFs . Of particular interest is the role of affect in conflict monitoring, which has been addressed within the framework of the affective-signaling hypothesis . Another focus could be the specificity of the influence of PM on different kinds of SCFs, for example comparing dietary SCFs with SCFs in social situations. To summarize, research aiming to elucidate more aspects of self-control in daily life as well as studies connecting PM and self-control in daily life to within-task measures of neural implementation of control are warranted. Limitations of the current study include that even though EMA has been shown to have high ecological validity, compared to other methods, as it does measure behavior in daily life, it cannot be excluded that the assessment itself has effects on behavior. Because participants are instructed to monitor themselves, EMA could function as an intervention and thus dampen ecological validity . Regarding the analysis, while aenet regression does improve prediction accuracy and robustness by shrinking estimated parameters or setting them to zero and can handle correlated predictors, it does not take into account the structure of the data that is spatially and temporally correlated . Depending on the tuned hyperparameters it is also possible that the aenet selects just one subgroup of correlated variables as a representative for the correlated predictors. Consequently, important variables might be missed in the presence of this subgroup of variables correlated with them . This may also be an explanation for why ERN time points at other frontocentral sites failed to be selected as predictors. Future studies should consider these aspects, increasing interpretability. Aside from these measurement and analysis concerns, our sample size could have been larger to optimize prediction. The ERN, as a neural correlate of PM processes, appears to predict self-control in daily life. Previously, regulatory control has mainly been assessed using within-task performance measures. However, such measures have been criticized for their lack of ecological validity. Our design sought to remedy these shortcomings, and we were able to establish a more ecologically valid connection between lab-based assessment of PM and self-control in daily life. Altered cognitive control processes and PM have been proposed as underlying mechanisms for various mental disorders , and the ERN amplitude in particular has been shown to be associated with various psychopathologies, including OCD and SUD . Understanding how alterations in PM relate to regulatory control might therefore aid in delineating the type of deficit exhibited and developing targeted treatment strategies for affected individuals.

37,37,"The Impact of Television, Electronic Games, and Social Technology Use on Sleep and Health in Adolescents with an Evening Circadian Preference","There are mixed findings when examining if technology use is harmful for adolescent sleep and health. This study builds on these mixed findings by examining the association between technology use with sleep and health in a high-risk group of adolescents. Adolescents with an evening circadian preference (N = 176; 58% female, mean age = 14.77, age range = 10-18) completed measures over one week. Sleep was measured via actigraphy. Technology use and health were measured using ecological momentary assessment. Technology use was associated with an increase in sleep onset latency; with better emotional, social, cognitive, and physical health; and with worse behavioral health. This study offers support for technology use having some benefits and expands research on technology use to adolescents with an evening circadian preference.","[""Technology"", ""Sleep"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Actigraphy""]",10.1007/s10964-021-01429-9,"Introduction Adolescents have access to a wide range of technology . A recent survey found that 95% of adolescents have access to a smartphone at home, 88% of adolescents have access to a computer at home, and 84% of adolescents have access to a videogame console at home . However, it remains unclear if widespread technology use has a positive or negative impact on health. Indeed, while several recent studies have found that technology use is associated with poor sleep  and poor emotional, social, cognitive, physical, and behavioral health , others have found benefits to technology use . In light of these mixed findings, the question remains: does increased use of television, electronic games, and social technology contribute to poor sleep and poor health? The current study addresses this gap by examining the impact of technology use on sleep and health using ecological momentary assessment to evaluate these relationships in the daily life of adolescents with an evening circadian preference. Technology use, such as watching television, playing electronic games, and social uses, is associated with worse sleep outcomes among adolescents. Many studies and a systematic review have demonstrated that watching television is associated with shorter total sleep time , a later bedtime , and a longer sleep onset latency (i.e. time to fall asleep) . The pattern is similar for electronic games: playing electronic games has been associated with a shorter total sleep time , a later bedtime , and a longer sleep onset latency . Social uses, including texting and social media, are also associated with shorter total sleep time , a later bedtime , and a longer sleep onset latency . This negative relationship between sleep and technology use may be driven by multiple factors, as proposed in prior theories . First, technology use may be directly replacing sleep or other positive, sleep-promoting activities, such as physical activity. Second, technology use increases physiological arousal, which may decrease the homeostatic sleep drive and can result in difficulty relaxing. Third, technology use increases bright light exposure, which delays the circadian rhythm and suppresses melatonin production. There is also a negative relationship between adolescent technology use-across television, electronic games, and social uses-and health across five domains: emotional, social, cognitive, physical, and behavioral. In the emotional health domain, technology use has been associated with symptoms of depression  and with suicidal ideation . In the social health domain, technology use has been associated with decreased social connectedness and increased loneliness and aggression . In the cognitive health domain, technology use has been associated with increased problems focusing attention . In the physical health domain, technology use has been associated with decreased physical activity . In the behavioral health domain, technology use has been associated with increased behavioral problems , such as externalizing behaviors . Risk across these health domains can be attributed to adolescence being a period characterized by rapid neural, hormonal, and physical development. Indeed, beginning with the onset of puberty, adolescence is characterized by development in the connectivity and maturation of brain regions responsible for emotional responsivity and impulse control (e.g. amygdala, prefrontal cortex). The rapid neural changes and, at times imbalanced immaturity of neural development, has been theorized to contribute to increased risk for engagement in emotionally-driven behaviors across all five health domains . However, several recent studies have called into question whether technology use is always harmful. Indeed, multiple studies have concluded that technology use does not negatively impact sleep or health , although there are ongoing debates focused on methodological approaches . One possible explanation is that technology use may be used as a distraction to reduce the worry and rumination that often impairs sleep . Relatedly, technology use has been associated with both a reduction in same day mood and anxiety symptoms  and limited technology use (e.g. 1-2 h) appears to be associated with better health . It is clear that additional research is needed to understand these mixed findings. This study focuses on adolescents with an evening circadian preference, or ""night owls"". These adolescents follow a delayed schedule, with a preference for a later bedtime and increased activity later in the day ). An evening circadian preference is associated with sleep problems during adolescence, most notably a delayed bedtime and insufficient total sleep time . Adolescents with an evening circadian preference are also at increased risk for a range of negative health outcomes. These include depression and anxiety in the emotional health domain , aggressive and antisocial behavior in the social health domain , poor academic performance in the cognitive health domain , obesity in the physical health domain , and substance use and impulsivity in the behavioral health domain . Taken together, adolescents with an evening circadian preference may be particularly vulnerable to negative consequences of technology use on sleep  and health . The extent to which technology use contributes to sleep and/or health risk for adolescents with an evening circadian preference remains unclear. Ecological momentary assessment may be helpful to further understand the relationship between technology use and both sleep and health in daily life. Ecological momentary assessment involves the repeated sampling of an individual's current experiences as they are in their regular environment . Ecological momentary assessment has several advantages. It maximizes ecological validity, allows for repeated assessments, permits the examination of day-by-day experiences, and minimizes retrospective recall . Ecological momentary assessment methods may offer new insights as prior studies have tended to rely heavily on retrospective questionnaires that ask the participant to average across time  or on parent reports of their adolescent's behavior . Current Study As the field remains mixed on if the use of television, electronic games, and social technology contribute to poor sleep and poor health, the overarching goal of the present study is to utilize ecological momentary assessment to evaluate the impact of technology use among adolescents with an evening circadian preference. The first aim is to examine the association between technology use and sleep. The hypothesis tested is that technology use at bedtime will be associated with worse sleep, operationalized as shorter total sleep time, a later bedtime, and a longer sleep onset latency. The second aim is to examine the concurrent association between technology use and the five health domains . The hypothesis tested is that technology use will be associated with worse health across each of the five health domains. Methods Participants Participants were 176 adolescents (mean age = 14.77, 58% female) in the United States drawn from those recruited to participate in a NICHD-funded trial designed to modify the psychosocial, behavioral, and cognitive processes that contribute to an evening circadian preference among adolescents . Participants were recruited through clinician referrals and advertisements. Participant demographics are described in Table . Participants were eligible if they (a) were between 10 and 18 years old, living with a parent or guardian, and attending a class/job by 9am at least three days per week, (b) were fluent in English, (c) were able and willing to give informed assent, (d) reported an evening circadian preference as demonstrated by scoring in the lowest quartile on the Children's Morningness-Eveningness Preference Scale (27 or lower), had a 7-day sleep diary showing a sleep onset time of 10:40 pm or later for 10-13-year-olds, 11 pm or later for 14-16-year-olds, and 11:20 pm or later for 17-18year-olds at least three nights per week, and this pattern was present for at least three months, and (e) fell in the ""at-risk"" range on measures in at least one of five health domains described in greater detail in Supplement 1. Individuals were excluded if there was (a) an active, progressive physical illness or neurodegenerative disease directly related to the onset and course of the sleep disturbance, (b) evidence of obstructive sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or periodic limb movement disorder, (c) significantly impairing pervasive developmental disorder, (d) bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or another Axis I disorder if there were risk of harm if treatment were delayed, (e) a history of substance abuse in the past six months, and (f) current suicide risk to preclude treatment on an outpatient basis. Individuals ceased taking medications that alter sleep four weeks prior to the assessment (two weeks for melatonin) or were excluded. Measures Sleep Sleep was assessed via actigraphy. The Actiwatch Spectrum (Philips Respironics, Bend, Oregon, USA) is a wrist-worn device containing an accelerometer to measure physical motion. Actigraphy is an objective measure of sleep and has been validated against polysomnography, the gold standard objective measure, in adolescents . For seven days, participants were asked to wear an actiwatch on their nondominant wrist and instructed to remove the actiwatch only when showering. Activity data was logged in 30 sec epochs and analyzed using the Actiware software v.6 (Philips Respironics, Bend, Oregon, USA). The scoring algorithm's sensitivity for wake/sleep detection was set to medium. The main sleep window was the longest period of sleep identified by the scoring algorithm within a 24hour window. Following recommendations in the field, sleep diary data that was collected concurrently  was used to adjust the sleep window as needed . The variables of interest were total sleep time, bedtime, and sleep onset latency as these have been implicated in prior studies examining technology use in adolescents . Ecological momentary assessment Health and technology use were assessed via ecological momentary assessment. Participants received calls from a trained research assistant over one week. Assessments were conducted twice on weekdays between 4 pm and 9 pm and four times on weekends between 11am and 9 pm, for a total of up to 18 calls. Participants were instructed to turn off their cell phones during school. If a participant did not answer on the first attempt, the call was attempted again immediately and then again after 5 min. There were at least 30 min between each call. Each call consisted of a brief structured interview. The interview delivered was based on prior research  and adapted to evaluate the five health domains. The coding of the ecological momentary assessments was also adapted from the methods of a prior study . Specifically, the interview responses were transcribed verbatim. Five coders independently coded a subset of the data (5%) with 93.21% agreement with an ""expert coder"" (NBG). To be a certified coder, coders had to match at over 80% accuracy with the expert coder for a minimum of 54 consecutive calls. Then each coder independently coded a subset of the data. Health The five health domains were measured via ecological momentary assessment. Variables in each domain were calculated using the same method as prior research from this dataset . Emotional domain A short form adapted from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children (PANAS-C)  was employed during each call. Four positive emotions were assessed: happy, cheerful, interested, and excited. Five negative emotions were assessed: sad, nervous, upset, angry, and bored. Positive emotions in each call were averaged to create a positive affect score. Negative emotions in each call were averaged to create a negative affect score. Adolescents were asked to rate these emotions on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = moderately, 4 = quite a bit, 5 = extremely). Social domain Social health was measured by calculating a positivity ratio of positive affect to negative affect when adolescents reported they were alone, with family, or with friends at the time of each ecological momentary assessment call. In addition to reporting their emotions (see emotional domain above), adolescents reported they were with at a given call (""At the moment the phone rang, was anyone else with you?""). These responses were binned into being alone, with a family member, or with a friend. Cognitive domain Cognitive health was assessed by examining ratings of adolescents' difficulty with concentration ("" To what extent was it difficult for you to concentrate on the task?""), getting distracted (""To what extend were you distracted?""), and ability to focus attention (""To what extent were you able to focus your attention?"") on their current activity during each call. Adolescents were asked to rate each of these items on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = moderately, 4 = quite a bit, 5 = extremely). A composite score of all three items was also created. Physical domain Physical health was assessed as a binary variable (1 = active, 2 = inactive) derived by questions from prior research . Physical activity was assessed only in the final ecological momentary assessment call each day by asking ""Were you physically active today?"" and ""What activities did you do?"" Behavioral domain Behavioral health was calculated by creating a composite score of the consumption of junk food, caffeine use, alcohol use, tobacco use, and other substance use during each call. Technology use Technology use was measured using the same ecological momentary assessment procedures described above. During each call, participants responded to the question, ""At the moment the phone rang, what were you doing?"" Responses were coded and technology use was identified. The type of technology use was categorized into one of three categories: television, electronic games (e.g., video games, computer games), or social uses (e.g., social media, texting). Procedure Participants completed ecological momentary assessment measures to assess health and technology use and wore an actiwatch concurrently over one week. These data were collected prior to any participant received treatment as part of the broader clinical trial . Data were collected in 2013-2016. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board. All participants provided informed assent or consent. Data Analysis Data analyses were conducted in Stata15. Hierarchical linear modeling using maximum likelihood estimation was used to address the aims of this study. This statistical method can account for the associations between repeated measurements and does not have the same missing data restrictions of traditional regression analyses. Sleep and health variables were standardized. Standardized coefficients were calculated, as these are interpretable as effect sizes . The first aim of this study only included technology use during the final ecological momentary assessment call of each day in the analyses in order to evaluate the relationship between technology use and sleep as closely as possible. To verify that we assessed the relationship between technology use and sleep as directly as possible, we examined the timing of ecological momentary assessment calls. The average ecological momentary assessment call was at 19.66 decimal hours (SD = 2.61), or 7:40 PM. The average distance between the final call of the day and an adolescent's bedtime was 4.09 decimal hours (SD = 2.82). In order to increase temporal accuracy between technology use and bedtime, this study only included calls that were within one standard deviation from the mean, or within 1.27 decimal hours of an adolescent's bedtime. This reduced the sample size for the first aim to 68 data points drawn from 39 participants. The second aim of this study included all calls. For the first aim of this study, previous night's sleep (total sleep time, bedtime, and sleep onset latency), age, sex, Children's Morningness-Eveningness Preference Scale score, and a dummy variable indicating if the night assessed was a weekday or weekend were included as covariates in the fixed part of the model. For the second aim of this study, age and sex were included as covariates in the fixed part of the model. The random part of all models included a random intercept for participant, assumed to have a bivariate normal distribution with a mean of zero and an unstructured covariance matrix. A significance level of 0.05 was used throughout. Missing Data The average number of EMA calls per participant was 9.24 (SD = 5.11). Data was assumed to be missing at random and multilevel models as used in the present study can account for missing data. All available data was used in the present study. Results Table  presents the descriptive statistics for the study variables. The average total sleep time was 448.29 min (SD = 10.13 min), the average bedtime was 22.21 decimal hours, or 10:12 pm (SD = 0.14 decimal hours), and the average sleep onset latency was 33.46 min (SD = 6.64 min). For the emotional health domain, positive affect was rated on average as a little to moderate (mean = 2.54, SD = 0.02) and negative affect was rated on average as very slightly/not at all to a little (mean = 1.42, SD = 0.01). For the health social domain, the average positivity ratio ranged as very slightly to moderately (mean = 1.83-2.51, SD = 0.03-0.06). For cognitive health domain, overall cognitive problems were rated on average as a little to moderately challenging (mean = 2.31, SD = 0.01). For the physical health domain, adolescents were on average more active than not (mean = 1.47, SD = 0.02). For the behavioral health domain, adolescents reported few behavioral problems (mean = 0.08, SD = 0.00). Table  presents correlations between all the sleep and health outcome variables. Technology Use and Sleep As evident in Table , technology use was associated with an increased sleep onset latency (ß = 0.65, p < 0.01) with a  Technology Use and Health The results are presented in Table . Technology use was associated with better health in the emotional domain. Television and electronic game use were significantly associated with increased positive affect (ß = 0.10-0.44, p = 0.00-0.01) and lower negative affect (ß = −0.31-0.21, p < 0.001). Also, television use was significantly associated with an increase in ratings of happy and interested and with a decrease in ratings of sad, upset, and bored. Electronic game use was significantly associated with higher ratings of happy, cheerful, interested, and excited, and with lower ratings of sad and bored. While social uses were not significantly associated with positive affect and negative affect, social uses were associated with lower ratings of excited, interested, and nervous. Technology use was associated with better health in the social domain. Specifically, television use was significantly associated with a higher positivity ratio among adolescents when they were alone (ß = 0.31, p < 0.001), but not when adolescents were with family or with friends. Electronic game use was significantly associated with higher positivity ratios when adolescents were alone, with family, and with friends (ß = 0.51-0.57, p = 0.00-0.04). Social uses were not associated with the positivity ratio when adolescents were alone, with family, or with friends. Technology use was significantly associated with better health in the cognitive domain (ß = 0.62, p = 0.01). In particular, television use was significantly associated with less difficulty concentrating and with being less distracted. Electronic game use was associated with less difficulty concentrating and less difficulty focusing attention. Social uses were significantly associated with less difficulty concentrating and with being less distracted. Technology use was associated with better health in the physical domain. Specifically, electronic game use was significantly associated with increased physical activity (ß = 0.30, p = 0.04). Television and social uses were not associated with physical health. Finally, technology use was associated with worse health in the behavioral domain. Specifically, television use was associated with increased behavioral problems (ß = 0.26, p < 0.001). Electronic game use and social uses were not associated with behavioral health. Sensitivity Analyses Alternative models were explored as a part of sensitivity analyses. First, we examined if technology use was associated with subsequent sleep using the last call of the day within the entire sample regardless of how close the final call was to bedtime. Results displayed a similar pattern to the reported findings, although they were not significant (total sleep time: ß = 0.13, p = 0.38; bedtime: ß = 0.05, p = 0.63; sleep onset latency: ß = 3.58, p = 0.18). Second, we examined if any technology use was associated with concurrent health, collapsing across all three categories of technology use. No other analyses were conducted and we have reported all decisions for excluding participants in the Methods section. Discussion The literature on the impact of technology use on adolescent sleep and health is mixedat times, technology use has been found not to have an impact on adolescent sleep and health (e.g., , while at other times it has been shown to be harmful (e.g.,  or helpful (e.g., . One possibility for these disparate findings is the measurement of technology use, as existing studies have relied on parent-report of adolescent behavior or on retrospective averages. The impact of technology use in adolescents with an evening circadian preference, a group of adolescents at increased risk for a range of problematic outcomes across several domains of adolescent health, is not yet known. To address prior methodological concerns and examine technology use in this high risk sample, the goal of the present study was to use ecological momentary assessment to examine the impact of technology use on both sleep and health in adolescents with an evening circadian preference. The first aim was to examine if technology use predicted worse sleep among adolescents with an evening circadian preference. In partial support of the hypothesis, technology use was associated with an increase in sleep onset latency. This finding is consistent with prior literature demonstrating that technology use increases sleep onset latency . Notably, the findings (Unstandardized ß = 35.87 min) suggest that technology use had a clinically-relevant impact on sleep onset latency, as a sleep onset latency of 30 min is often considered to serve as a cutoff for clinical significance . Contrary to the hypothesis, technology use was not associated with total sleep time or bedtime. These findings contribute to the mixed findings on the relationship between technology use adolescent sleep . The second aim was to examine the association between adolescent technology use and health. In partial support, technology use-specifically watching television-was associated with worse health in the behavioral domain. This finding is congruous with prior research demonstrating that  + positivity ratios do not overlap so cannot calculate correlations between them watching television is associated with increased behavioral difficulties among adolescents . Contrary to the hypothesis, and consistent with the recently debated research reporting that technology use is not harmful to adolescent health , technology use was associated with better health in the emotional, social, cognitive, and physical domains. Specifically, in the emotional and social domains, watching television (when alone) and playing electronic games (alone, with family and with friends) were associated with higher positive affect and lower negative affect. The results are also consistent with research demonstrating that technology use can improve mood symptoms  and with research showing that playing electronic games can foster an increased sense of social connectedness and community , which may reduce negative emotion. Furthermore, in the cognitive domain, television, electronic games, and social uses were all associated with higher cognitive functioning, which is not consistent with prior research . This finding is unexpected. Perhaps adolescents are poor reporters of their concentration or perhaps they were reporting how focused they were on their current technology use, as adolescents often underestimate the effects of their multitasking while using technology (e.g., technology plus another activity or multiple technologies at once, May and Elder 2018). In the physical domain, the findings that electronic games use was associated with increased physical activity is not consistent with theory , although is in line with research about the benefits of physically active video game use . As technology use may take up time that would otherwise be used to engage in other recreational activities , future research should explore the function of technology use (e.g., to socialize with friends, to be physically active, to escape or cope with negative emotions). Technology use for social uses (e.g., social media) had no negative effects on adolescent health. These findings are inconsistent with studies highlighting problems with social media use among adolescents, specifically that social media is associated with increased anxiety, depression, and loneliness as well as with lower self-esteem . However, the findings from the present study are consistent with recent literature that has demonstrated that social media use does not negatively impact adolescent health . There are at least possible interpretations. First, the statistical analyses conducted for the present study did not examine the health domain in which each adolescent was ""at-risk"" as most adolescents were at risk in multiple health domains and this would add many more comparisons. Therefore, perhaps risk in a particular health domain or combination of health domains may render adolescents more susceptible to problems with technology for social uses, and this is an important domain for future research. Second, perhaps social uses are helpful or harmful based on the function of using technology itself (i.e. what is the function of the behavior of using social media?). For example, social media used to distract oneself to reduce anxiety by looking at cute animal pictures/videos may prove helpful. In contrast, looking at pictures from a party that an adolescent was not invited to may be harmful. Hence, future studies examining the reasons why adolescents use technology in a given moment and the association with health would be beneficial. Several limitations should be noted. First, as technology use and health were assessed concurrently during each ecological momentary assessment call, we are unable to establish the temporal relationship between technology use and the health domains. Perhaps technology use and health have a bidirectional relationship. This should be explored in future studies. Second, this sample was comprised of adolescents with an evening circadian preference, a group of adolescents who are particularly at-risk for negative sleep and health outcomes . Future research is needed with other groups of adolescents (e.g., those with a morning circadian preference) or in individuals who are not experiencing health risk in order to increase the generalizability of the findings. However, as 40% of adolescents experience an evening circadian preference, the present findings seem likely to apply to a large swath of adolescents . Third, due to the variability in the timing of the ecological momentary assessment calls, the sample was small for the first aim (n = 39 participants, n = 68 calls), which evaluated the relationship between technology use and sleep. However, this subsample was representative of the larger sample (mean Future studies could include a measure of pubertal status. Sixth, multiple comparisons were used. Corrections for multiple comparisons further reduce power, increase the probability of a Type II error, and contribute to publication bias . Hence, we included effect sizes as suggested by . Standardized coefficients, as presented, are interpretable as effect sizes . Seventh, data were collected in 2013-2016. As technology is rapidly advancing, these findings may not reflect all of today's available technology. Eighth, the measures used do not allow for reliability analyses. Ninth, we did not assess why adolescents chose to use technology at bedtime. For example, bedtime procrastination has been associated with an evening circadian preference and may contribute to increased technology use . Future studies should assess contributors to bedtime technology use. Finally, while the selection items to include in the health measures was adapted from a prior interview , this measure has not yet been validated. Conclusion Research and theory have identified that technology use may contribute to problems with adolescent sleep and health. However, much of this work has relied on parent reports of adolescent behavior or retrospective reports. To this end, the present study sought to use ecological momentary assessment to examine the impact of three  Compliance with Ethical Standards Conflict of Interest The authors declare no competing interests.

38,38,Understanding at-the-moment stress for parents during COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions,"In spring 2020, many states in the United States enacted stay-at-home orders to limit the spread of COVID-19 and lessen effects on hospitals and health care workers. This required parents to act in new roles without much support. Although studies have asked parents about stress before and during the pandemic, none have examined how stress may have fluctuated throughout the day and the characteristics related to those daily changes.Objective: Our study assesses how time-varying (e.g., presence of a focal child) and day-varying (e.g., weekend vs. weekday) factors were related to parents' level of stress. Methods: We use Ecological Momentary Assessment to examine stress three times a day (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p. m.) for 14 days. We include two different dates hypothesized to be related to parents' stress levels: (1) when Ohio announced schools would go virtual for the rest of the academic year and (2) when most retail businesses were allowed to re-open. Our sample of 332 individuals, recruited via Facebook, Craigslist, and word of mouth, completed 13,360 of these brief surveys during April-May 2020. Data were analyzed using generalized ordered logit models. Results: Parents report lower levels of stress when completing the 9 p.m. survey, but higher levels when they were at work, during weekdays (compared to weekends) or when they were with the focal child. COVID-19 milestone dates were not related to stress levels. Conclusions: Parents need some form of respite (e.g. child care, child-only activities) to reduce stress, especially during the week when parents are juggling their outside employment and their child(ren)'s schooling. Providing parents with skills and tools to identify and reduce stress, such as apps monitoring heart rate or providing deep breathing techniques, may be one way of helping parents cope with extremely stressful situations.","[""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Stress"", ""Parents"", ""COVID-19"", ""Generalized ordered logit models""]",10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114025,"Introduction The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused widespread psychosocial stress and social and economic disruption. In spring 2020, it disrupted life. Government and public health officials in a majority of states in the United States enacted shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders to limit the spread of the virus and lessen the effects on hospitals and health care workers. These extraordinary measures required parents to act in a variety of new roles without much support. During this time, parents felt higher levels of stress due to forced changes in their routines, including through loss of childcare and the switch to virtual K-12 school-often while trying to work from home (American Psychological Association [APA], 2020a; . Essential workers, including cashiers at local grocery and big box stores, had to navigate childcare center closures and making new arrangements with pandemic childcare centers . Extracurricular activities for children were cancelled, leaving children with few outlets for engagement or entertainment outside of the home. Yet, while there is indication that parental stress may be increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about how that stress may fluctuate over time and circumstances. Identifying the situations and contexts where parents experience the most stress could help the development of targeted interventions to promote family well-being. In Ohio, the first cases of COVID-19 were detected on March 9, 2020, with the first death occurring 11 days later on March 20, 2020. K-12 schools were initially shut down on March 17 and ultimately shut down for the rest of the academic year on April 20, 2020. The first stay-athome order began on midnight March 24, 2020. Stay-at-home restrictions ultimately lasted until May 29, 2020; however, a phased roll out of businesses re-opening began May 1, 2020. Most consumer and retail businesses were able to open on May 12, 2020 . Stress, Health, and Well-Being among Parents. Parenting stress is not unique to the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents generally report feeling more stressed  and less happy  than comparable groups of non-parents throughout the developed world. Some of this stress is attributable to the act of parenting itself  and is variable depending on children's gender, age, and number of children . Mothers of boys, for example, have been found to experience higher levels of parenting stress than mothers of girls . Child age has also been associated with parental stress, with findings suggesting that stress is particularly high among parents of infants and toddlers , decreases into the preschool and early school age years  and then increases as children enter adolescence . The addition of subsequent children to a family also increases the stress felt by parents . A preponderance of research evidence demonstrates that the act of parenting, regardless of the individual characteristics of children, is stressful. These pressures experienced by parents have been associated with a number of parental and family characteristics as well. Stressors experienced by parents are lessened by having adequate financial resources  and higher levels of educational attainment independent of financial well-being , though  found increased stress among parents with both high and low levels of education compared to parents with intermediate levels and  also found increased stress among highly-educated parents. Parents who are parenting within the context of a partnered relationship generally have lower stress compared to single parents; this pattern holds for children of a variety of ages . Parents' stress is likely heightened by the interaction between their role as parent and other life domains. Parents experience significant financial pressures ) that increases their overall experiences of life stress . Employed parents also experience strain as a result of conflict between their role as parent and their role as employee  and spillover of work stress into their parenting life . Increased relationship conflict  and feelings of social isolation  have further been theorized to be associated with increased feelings of stress and decreased well-being for parents. Many of these stressors became commonplace during the COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions . For example, parents who were sheltering in place may experience social isolation, while those that are juggling both working from home and assisting with children who are distance learning may feel enhanced role conflict. This stress could vary throughout the day, with spikes at particular times, such as during work and distance learning hours. In the current study, we were able to assess how parents' stress levels changed throughout the day and those characteristics that varied with stress levels. Parents may find some relief or respite when they are able to spend even small amounts of time away from the home. Stress and Parenting: COVID-19, Natural and Macroeconomic Disasters. The impact of other community-level disrupters-natural and macroeconomic disasters-may provide important insight into parental behavior when families are thus challenged. Natural disasters lead to closing schools and businesses, shifts in routines, decreased resources, and increased stress ; and macroeconomic events can lead to job loss and recession, similar to the pandemic event. Natural disasters and macroeconomic events contributed to parental disengagement and avoidance behavior such as refusal to talk about the situation , use of substances to self-soothe , and inability to monitor and support children . Natural disasters, regardless of the type or location, were linked to fear-oriented maladaptive parenting strategies such as excessive parental control, reduction in child autonomy, increased protectiveness, and hypervigilance . Macroeconomic events were associated with decreased parenting satisfaction and increased authoritative mothering , and maternal harsh parenting . Family-level factors can mitigate the consequences of disasters. Education level was associated with coping and resource utilization, contributing to lower negative impacts  and family resiliency . Intimate partners were found to be both contributors to and alleviators of family stress . Taken together, this research indicates that significant disruptions to work, school, and economic institutions such as those during the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively impact parenting behaviors, potentially through increased parental stress. This suggests that children throughout the United States may be experiencing COVID-19 related maladaptive parenting. A more nuanced understanding of the factors associated with parental stress during the COVID-19 pandemic could reveal potential opportunities for preventive intervention. Emerging research indicates that parent perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 are associated with increased parenting stress . The attempts to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19 have created challenges of financial insecurity, caregiver burden, and isolation that are likely to increase parent stress . Cumulative stressors resulting from COVID-19 were significantly and positively related to perceived stress , and poor work-family balance, economic uncertainty, and reduced social support experienced due to COVID-19 containment measures were linked to higher parenting stress . Although mothers  were at higher risk for distress, both parents in co-parenting households showed increased depression, anxiety, and stress . Parents world-wide reported higher levels of stress after school closures . Poor work-family balance may lead to higher levels of stress during the week when these role conflicts are likely to be highest with virtual schooling. Notably, these effects of increasing stress associated with COVID-19 appear independent of characteristics such as child's age  and the number of children in a household . Current Study. Although we know parents have experienced significant stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, no studies to date have examined how parents' stress levels fluctuate throughout the day and factors associated with that fluctuation. Examining this variation may help us identify small changes parents can make in their routine to help them better manage those stress levels. The research question for the current study is: How do time-varying, day-varying, and individual-level varying characteristics relate to at-the-moment stress during COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions in Ohio? Based on the work presented here, we hypothesize (1) higher levels of stress later in the day when role conflict is likely to be highest; (2) higher levels of stress for those parents who spent time at work; (3) higher levels of stress in the time period after the April 20, 2020 announcement that K-12 schooling would remain virtual through the end of the 2019-20 academic year; and (4) lower stress (possibly due to reduced social isolation) after most retail businesses are allowed to be open in some fashion on May 12, 2020. We use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to identify factors related to at-the-moment stress for parents during a two-week time period during COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions in Central Ohio. EMA is a research technique that pushes out brief surveys multiple times a day to understand how microcontexts might affect behavior . These factors are time-varying (e.g., time of day, location, presence of focal child), day-varying (e.g., day of week), or individual-varying (e.g., app version downloaded). We include measures that track specific COVID-19 restrictions, to assess their relationship to stress experience by parents. Methods Study Design. An ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study was conducted with parents of at least one child between the ages of 2 and 12 in Central Ohio during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. As part of this study, parents responded to survey prompts three times a day (10 a.m., 3 p.m., 9 p.m.) for a total of 14 days. The 3-5 min brief surveys asked questions about level of stress, location where the survey was being taken, and whether the focal child had been with the parent since the last survey. Parents were recruited online through advertisements on Facebook and Craigslist and word of mouth. We posted those recruitment advertisements and began assessing initial eligibility via online surveys on April 11, 2020. Eligibility was determined using a Qualtrics survey that assessed participant age (≥18 years), number of children between the ages of 2 and 12 (must have at least one), primary residence (must be in Central Ohio), availability of a smartphone to be used to for the research team to push out the brief surveys, and their contact information. Once eligibility was determined, the study team contacted the potential participant via email to set up a time to obtain verbal consent and provide the next steps of the study. Verbal consent was obtained for all participants. We enrolled our first participants on April 13th, about a month after Ohio's stay-at-home restrictions were ordered. Our first EMA surveys were conducted on April 14, 2020, with data collection ending on May 27, 2020. As an incentive, participants received $1 for every brief survey completed, an extra $2 per day if all three EMA surveys were completed on a particular day, and an additional $10 for completing at least 90% (at least 37) of the surveys. The average number of surveys completed for those who provided verbal consent and completed at least one EMA survey, was 40.4 (range 18-42). IRB approval was obtained [BLINDED FOR REVIEW]. Participants were also asked to complete a baseline survey with information on demographics. These data are used to understand the characteristics of parents included in the sample. However, as they are not time-varying characteristics, we do not include them in the multivariate analyses. Sample. Our final sample includes 332 individuals, who completed 13,360 brief surveys. We had 629 individuals begin the screening survey. 150 were found to be ineligible or did not complete the screening survey (e.g., dropped off when required to provide a first name), with the remaining 479 successfully screening into the survey. Of those that screened in, 342 consented to participate in the study, with 332 of those who consented completing at least one EMA brief survey. Our sample is primarily female (>90%), highly educated with greater than 40% of respondents having a graduate degree, and high income (30.8% of households had incomes with greater than $120,000). Focal children in our sample were primarily white (77.3%), with slightly more boys (56.5%) than girls (see Table ). Measures. Our dependent variable-stress-was measured using a one-item question asking participants to rate their level of stress from 1 (low) to 10 (high) since the last survey, adapted from a study conducted by the American Psychological Association (2014). The specific question asks ""How would you rate your stress since the last survey?"" The one-item measure has face validity. Comparing this measure with the Perceived Stress Scale (10-items; , the one-item measure was highly positively correlated (ρ = 0.682; APA, 2014). The original responses were poorly distributed for Gaussian models, making the most efficient approach to using these data through an ordinal categorical model. We recoded the variables to five categories (see Table ) in order to aid in interpretation and model convergence. On average, parents reported that their stress level was 3.25 out of 10. In addition to stress, the time-varying characteristics used as independent variables included location where the parent was completing the survey, the trigger time for the survey, and whether a focal child was with the parent since the last survey. Locations included home (used as referent category in our study), work, store, child's activities (including at child's school), traveling between locations, or other (including restaurants). The majority of daily EMAs were completed with participants at home (86.7%, n = 11,581) and when the child had been with the parent during the survey time period (91.4%, n = 12,209). Daily characteristics included the day of the week (with Sunday as the reference group) and week of the study (reference group was week of April 12, 2020). The only participant-varying characteristic was the version of the app installed on the participant's cellular telephone. During the duration of our study, the research app we used released two versions to fix patches and provide additional functionality. Although we did not expect this variable to be statistically significant, we include it as a control variable where Version 4:04.0 is used as the reference group. Finally, we include two different dates we hypothesized to be related to parents' stress levels. Ohio Governor DeWine announced on April 20, 2020 that K-12 schooling would remain virtual through the end of the 2019-20 academic year. The second date, May 12, 2020, was the date most retail businesses were allowed to open with social distancing requirements in place, indicating greater freedom for families. We also include specific information about the child and family as covariates in this model: age of the focal child, his or her biological sex, number of children in the family, number of adults in the family, and education of the parent. We recoded child age into three categories: ages 2 to 5; ages 6 to 9; and ages 10 to 12. Data Analysis. For this study, we had observations (Level 1) nested within days (Level 2), nested within participants (Level 3). We used generalized ordered logit models  to account for clustering due to nesting of observations within days and participants and assess proportional effects for each covariate on the ordered outcome. This procedure incorporates a robust variance estimator that accounts for nesting of observations within days within participants. A key assumption of ordered logit models is that covariates have proportional effects across all levels of the dependent measure's ordered categories; in our case this is the five levels of stress. When this assumption is violated covariates may nevertheless be found to have effects related to one level of the ordinal outcome, but not others. To address this, we tested for non-parallel effects for all covariates with p < .05. If significant, we present tests for effects at each level within that block of measures, again assessing significance at p < .05. We also conducted missing data analyses to assess how our results may differ due to missing data. By design, the 332 respondents included in the final analyses were to provide 3 assessments per day over 14 days (42 total) for a study total of 13,944 assessments. We obtained 13,360 such assessments (95.8% of the total expected). For the missing assessments, 49.2% of the respondents were missing one or more assessments and 27% were missing two or more assessments. The median number missed assessments among those missing assessments was 6. There were few missing data among variables measured within assessments (less than 0.5% for any respondent) and no missing data within assessments for the 332 respondents included in the reported analyses. Missing data arose from missing assessments, not from missing responses within assessments. Based on this information, we examined how our results differed among respondents who completed all their daily assessments vs. those who did not complete all of their assessments. However, it remains possible that systematic biases existed between respondents who did and did not miss assessments which could bias assessments of covariate relationships. To be certain, we conducted logistic regression analyses of missingness across assessments. We present our findings from these analyses in the results section below. Results As shown in Table , Wald chi-square tests indicated that statistically significant relationships were observed between measured days of the week, parent locations, the presence of the focal child, one of the two COVID-19 orders, the trigger time of the survey, and the week the assessments occurred. A non-significant Wald test was found for the version of the app that was used by the participant. Daily stress varied by day of the week with parents reporting significantly more stress Monday through Friday (compared to Sunday). Parents completing the 9 p.m. survey (which could be completed between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. the following day) reported significantly less stress compared to the 10 a.m. survey. Being at work (compared to being at home) was related to significantly higher levels of stress among our sample. Across all parents, stress levels increased progressively throughout the period, peaking in the last week observed. As also shown in Table , presence of the focal child and the occurrence of the early April COVID order both had disproportionate effects across the ordered set of stress categories. Presence of the focal child during the survey window was related to greater stress, but only at the lowest categories of stress (1 and 2). Stress was somewhat greater when the participant was with the child during the timeframe, but only among parents reporting relatively low levels of stress. The first of the two COVID-19 specific milestones (announcing schools will remain virtual through the remainder of the academic year) exhibited disproportional odds and an overall significant Wald test, but no specific effect was significant. There was some indication that this order affected low levels of stress once again. Importantly, each successive week of the study (compared to the first week) was related to higher stress among parents; with this being statistically significant for the final weeks of the study. Note that this corresponds to when the Ohio Governor had begun to ease stay-at-home restrictions, including opening retail stores, bars, and restaurants for general public use. Those parents whose focal child was 10-12 years old reported lower levels of at-the-moment stress compared to parents with a focal child 2-4 years of age. Having one adult in the home is related to higher stress than two adults. The number of children under 18 years of age in the family, biological sex of the child, and parent's education was not related to at-the-moment stress for parents. Missing Data Analysis Results. As described above, we assessed covariate relationships among respondents with one or more missing assessments, which may differ from those with no missing assessments. We conducted a complete case analysis, using only data from those respondents with all 42 assessments, to see how they may differ from the results including all respondents. While substantially reduced in power, with N = 169 instead of 332, the results of this complete case analysis showed the same well-supported effects with one exception: Statistical support for the age effect was weak, shifting to p = .1344. Nevertheless, age effect parameters from the complete case model were much the same as those from the full analysis; greatest stress was reported among parents of the youngest children. It remains possible that systematic biases were to be found between respondents who did and did not miss assessments and these could bias assessments of covariate relationships. Logistic regression analyses of missingness across assessments revealed three differences: Missing assessments were more likely when reporting ""between places,"" earlier in the evening, and earlier in the day. A supplementary analysis of the full dataset, once reweighted using propensity scores for missingness at the assessment level, again showed that the same effects remained statistically well-supported. Discussion Our study sought to identify what at-the-moment situational characteristics were related to stress among parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although it is generally agreed that parents were likely under much higher levels of stress (APA, 2020a), we do not have much information on 'real-time' factors that might be affecting stress levels. In this study, we focused on situational (e.g., with child, location), time-varying (e.g., time of day), and day-varying (e.g., day of week) characteristics to assess when and where higher stress levels among parents occurred. Notably, our survey of parents reported lower levels of stress (average = 3.25 out of 10) than a study conducted by the APA (2020a), which found a mean of 6.7 among parents. One major difference in these studies is we asked parents about their level of stress three times a day, while the APA study asked parents to rate their stress for the past month. In our study, being with the child during the survey window was also related to higher levels of stress during COVID-19, but only at very low levels of stress. Further, we found that specific locations of where the parent was when completing the brief surveys were related to stress levels. If parents were working, then they reported higher stress levels, which mathes prior work that suggests parents often experience stress due to conflicting roles as caregiver and employee . The role of teacher during this time-as Ohio switched to virtual K-12 school-is likely to have only increased this conflict between roles. Given the unique circumstances of COVID-19, a  portion of our parents could be working at home where their children are participating in virtual school. This would be the ultimate case of work-life spillover, which is known to increase stress for parents . If so, this location might be capturing the stress of trying to work at home with children present and, in many cases, assisting them in completing their schoolwork. If parents are not working from home when they completed this item, then the significant relationship with stress may indicate that being at work, during these unprecedented times may increase stress. This pattern may be especially true if our parents are essential workers, regardless of whether they are health care professionals, first respondents, or retail workers at grocery or big box stores. It may also be that work for parents in our study is inherently stressful and that this relationship would be found under more 'usual' parenting circumstances. However, other locations, such as being at a child's activity or traveling between locations were unrelated to stress or reduced stressed (as evidenced by the Wald test showing that there are well-supported differences in stress across locations). Mirroring the findings from above, parents reported higher levels of stress on weekdays, compared to the weekends, in general. These findings are not surprising given the stressed experienced by parents to support and virtually teach their children, in the absence of daily on-site learning opportunities for schooling (APA, 2020a). On weekends, parents have greater freedom to arrange schedules or activities for their children that focus on enjoyable activities, rather than ensuring specific learning milestones occurred or homework was completed. We also found that parents' stress varied based on the time of day. We theorized that parents would report higher levels of stress later in the day, due to stress related to role conflict. We found no difference between stress at the morning and mid-day surveys. Our final survey was deployed at 9 p. m. and parents had until 1 a.m. the following day to complete it. Parents reported significantly less stress during that time period. Parents are likely to have been completing these surveys at the end of the day as parents are relaxing after their children have gone to bed. These lower levels of stress may be indicative of the relief that comes with having quiet time or extra time to one's self. We should note, however, that these relationships of day of the week and time of day may exist even when parenting is not occurring during a pandemic. Work by , for example, documents a pattern of increased stress for parents working outside of the home on workdays compared to non-work days.  also demonstrate a pattern of mothers rating their time with their children as generally stressful albeit more enjoyable, than time without children present. Both results are likely to represent decreased stress as a result of a reduction in the daily hassles of parenting . Additional research is needed in both crisis and non-crisis times on patterns of parental stress both across the course of their parenting days, including time with and away from their children, and across a parenting week, including school/non-school days. We hypothesized that specific milestones during this COVID-19 time period would increase a parent's stress level. However, we did not notice an increase in stress after the Governor of Ohio announced that schools would not re-open and learning would remain virtual through the end of the academic year, as had been found in Japan . Nor did we see a decrease in stress as parents had more freedom to go to retail stores, despite our hypothesis that this increased ability to move around might decrease social isolation among parents. As the pandemic continued to restrict movement and activities of families, we observed that stress levels increased compared to the first week we conducted the study . In particular, we see the highest levels of reported stress during the final week of our data collection period. This pattern may be a cumulative effect of having little to no respite from parenting duties, general concerns about staying safe during re-opening (APA, 2020b), or concern about keeping children safe as some activities began to resume, as suggested by . We find no difference in levels of stress for parents who reported on male vs. female focal child or based on the number of children in the family. These findings are similar to other COVID-19 studies examining parent stress . We did find that parents who had an older child, aged 10-12 years old, as the focal child had significantly lower stress than parents where the focal child was 2-4 years old. Here, our findings differ from those recent COVID-19 studies that show stress was not related to child age ). Yet, our findings are similar to other studies that show higher stress among families with toddlers and younger children . The difference may be due to the daily nature of at-the-moment stress where parents are providing real-time assessments. In our study, daily interactions with younger children are likely to be at the forefront of a parent's mind as he or she completes the survey compared to a global measure of stress where parents are retrospectively thinking about a past month. These results should be interpreted with caution due to the results of one of our missing data analyses. We found no difference in stress by parents education level, which differs from previous work (cf. . Having only one adult was also related to higher levels of stress. This is not surprising as parents had to adapt to act in multiple roles, made more complicated if there is no one else to share responsibilities during the pandemic. Historically, single parents have higher levels of stress compared to partnered parents . Limitations. Our study is limited in a number of ways. We did not ask about specific stressors related to COVID-19, such as whether a parent had lost a job or faced reduced hours, whether they had to work from home or going in to work, or whether a family member had been diagnosed with the COVID-19. Instead, we had to rely on the government response to try and identify significant factors in that response that might be related to parents' at-the-moment stress level. As a convenience sample of families recruited primarily through web-based ads and word of mouth in central Ohio, these results may not be generalizable beyond this setting. Similarly, our sample is largely white, female, and highly educated. These parents are likely to have more financial means at their disposal to buffer some of the financial effects of the pandemic. Studies examining whether the time-varying situational contexts found to be important predictors of stress in this study remain important under 'usual' parenting circumstances. Future work should examine whether these same time-varying situational contexts are related to stress in parents or if different contexts are more stressful for parents. In order to keep the daily surveys brief, we used one item to assess stress level of parents. Although this item has face validity, a multi-item scale or more robust measures of stress may provide better information on a parent's stress level. We also only assessed a small number of situational characteristics (e.g., time of day, location of parent) and did not get an assessment during homework and dinnertime hours. Future efforts may want to incorporate additional characteristics that may increase stress for parents and add additional measurement time periods. Given the lack of diversity in our sample, we are unable to fully assess whether populations are differentially affected by the situational characteristics presented here. Conducting the study with participants who have different characteristics, possibly recruited through non-web strategies, would allow us to assess a broader range of situational characteristics that might affect parenting when under extreme stress. One potential source of stress not measured here is reliable access to internet and availability of devices (e.g., computer, laptop, tablet) for children to obtain and complete assignments. Finally, we did not tease out whether parents who said they were at work during a survey time period were physically at work or working from home when the assessment was completed. Different stressors and stress levels during the pandemic might be present for parents who are conducting employment activities and monitoring virtual schooling, than those who are performing paid work outside of the home. Practice Implications. Through technological advances, we demonstrated that parent stress levels can be assessed in real-time, which offers several potential possibilities for intervention. As parents were able to engage with the smartphone-based research study, it is likely that they would be amenable to potential smartphone app interventions. Providing parents with skills and tools to identify and reduce stress, such as apps monitoring heart rate or providing deep breathing techniques, may be one way of helping parents cope with extremely stressful situations. These interventions could assess stress and provide resources when parents report high scores and use geodata to notify parents of local resources or support services as they pass nearby. Our findings also present implications for the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, or other future disasters that require sheltering-in-place. For example, parents need some form of respite (e.g. childcare, childonly activities) in order to reduce stress, especially during the week when parents are juggling their outside employment and their children's schooling. Locations or programs that would usually provide group activities (e.g., YMCA, youth sports leagues) might invest in identifying programming that maintains physical distance requirements and use of protective personal equipment (e.g., masks) for children. These activities could provide parents with a break and reduce their overall levels of stress. Foundations or other funding agencies (e.g., Department of Education) could subsidize these activities for low income and vulnerable children, youth, and families. Anecdotally, parents who have the financial ability to do so, are examining the possibility of using nannies during the school hours to help with virtual schooling to free up parents' time . This practice may further educationally harm children living in working class or poor homes that do not have the funds for this option. This may be exacerbated by whether the family has access to reliable internet . In a more equitable solution than private ""pods,"" public schools or non-profit agencies could form small groups of families to assist each other with childcare or distance learning, potentially providing a virtual staffed weekly ""check-in"" that would allow parents to process stress and emotions arising from sheltering-in-place with children. Expansion of the free lunch program to all students has been enacted in Ohio. This helps all families at least reduce the stress of having additional food on hand and is helpful for those families who are just above the income threshold for qualifying for free lunch. As stress can lead to a variety of health problems  and result in harsh parenting , identifying real-time situational contexts and developing strategies to change the environment that leads to these contexts may promote overall well-being in families. Conclusions Given the current context, much remains unknown about the immediate effects of the pandemic on families. Our work identifies a variety of factors that are related to higher levels of stress in parents. The parents and families in our study are not considered 'at-risk' and do not appear to be dealing with the same socio-economic challenges that many other families are facing. Yet, our study shows that even these relatively advantaged parents have been experiencing stress that is likely the result of change in routines and social connections due to COVID-19 restrictions . Although the specific milestones related to Ohio's stay-at-home orders were not related to higher levels of stress, we do identify situational characteristics that may serve to increase stress (e.g., being with the focal child). As such, this study provides a baseline of stress-levels found during the pandemic that can be compared to situational characteristics related to stress when life returns to something viewed as more 'normal' parenting conditions.

39,39,Use of Ecological Momentary Assessment to Study Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior: a Systematic Review,"Purpose of Review Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a recently introduced approach to patient evaluation that consists of asking patients questions in real time and in their usual habitat. This method seeks to contribute to suicide prevention by providing psychiatrists with detailed information about suicidal thoughts and behavior, how these fluctuate over short periods of time, and the short-term risk factors presented by patients. We conducted a systematic review of published research using EMA to study suicidal thoughts and behavior. Recent Findings Several systematic reviews of EMA in mental health have been conducted to date, and the literature contains numerous theoretical papers and compilations on EMA and suicide phenomena. To date, however, no systematic reviews have explored the use of this tool to study suicidal thoughts and behavior. Summary We performed a systematic review of five databases (i.e., PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) to identify studies on EMA and suicidal thoughts and behavior. An initial search revealed 544 articles. Following the study selection process, 35 studies were included in the review. Almost three-quarters of the studies were published in the last 4 years. The studies reviewed concluded that EMA was generally feasible and well accepted. EMA findings correlated well with the results of a retrospective assessment, though tended to over-represent symptom severity. Our review points to important aspects of suicidal thoughts and behavior, such as its wide fluctuation over short periods of time. Negative affect and disturbed sleep, among others, emerged as short-term predictors of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Therefore, EMA is a potentially useful tool in clinical practice, although not without drawbacks, such as participant fatigue with questionnaires and ethical concerns.","[""Suicide"", ""Suicide attempt"", ""Suicidal ideation"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Mobile health""]",10.1007/s11920-021-01255-7,"Introduction Suicide is the second leading cause of death worldwide among people between the ages of 15 and 29 years and therefore a major public health concern. While the global prevalence of suicide is over 800,000 cases a year, the number of suicide attempts (SA) is estimated to be at least 20 times this figure . Suicidal ideation (SI) is even more common: data from World Mental Health Surveys shows that each year, roughly 2% of people actively think about killing themselves (active SI) . Moreover, a recent meta-analysis found that passive SI (i.e., desire to be dead) ranges in prevalence from 5.8% in a single year to 10.6% over a lifetime . SA and SI (both active and passive), collectively termed suicidal thoughts and behavior (STB), are associated with death by suicide  and they alone pose a significant burden of disease . The direct and indirect costs of STB amount to billions of dollars every year . In 2013, the World Health Organization developed a mental health action plan, which set a goal of decreasing the incidence of death by suicide by 10% by the year 2020 . We are still far from reaching this goal. The search for reliable risk factors for STB is considered a crucial step in suicide prevention. However, research in this area has yielded disappointing results. The meta-analysis by  showed that our ability to predict suicidal behavior has not improved appreciably over the past 50 years, as none of the numerous risk factors described in the study is more accurate in predicting suicidal behavior than flipping a coin . Another reported weakness of suicide research is the scarcity of short-term risk factors . Most studies focus on longterm factors, which may not be as effective in preventing suicidal behavior, sometimes fluctuate over time, and require intensive monitoring in the short term. Also, traditional research methods have some limitations, such as the risk of recall bias, as participants' recollection of past events varies in accuracy . Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) may help overcome these shortcomings. EMA consists of asking participants questions on a daily basis to be answered at the moment, that is, with no interruption to their day-to-day routine. This provides real-time, continuous assessment that respects the ecological context of participants . EMA is especially useful in exploring short-term risk factors, as it can detect the immediate antecedents of a given behavior . Additionally, studying populations in their usual surroundings makes it possible to measure the role of contextual factors (or triggers) and the extent to which these may vary . Initially, EMA was performed using pencil and paper, requiring participants to carry booklets around with them. With the advent of new technologies, however, it became possible to perform EMA using personal digital assistants (PDAs) or smartphones. EMA has been used in different areas of mental health for a variety of purposes. There are several studies and subsequent systematic reviews on the use of EMA in depression , anxiety , psychotic disorders , child psychiatry , and substance use . However, until quite recently, EMA was an underutilized tool in suicide research ; this is despite its suitability for this purpose due to the peculiarities of SI, such as fluctuation over time, the need to identify short-term risk factors, and the benefits of close monitoring. Nowadays, there is increasing interest in EMA within suicide research, as shown by the publication of six papers on the topic so far this year . This is a rapidly advancing area in which constant updating and synthesis of the literature are needed. One previous systematic review of EMA as a research method explored non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) , an independent but related area to STB. Five narrative reviews have been published on the use of EMA in suicide research: three addressed STB in general , one reviewed smartphone-based EMA , and another focused on a particular aspect of STB, that is, the presence of sleep disturbances during suicidal crises . To our knowledge, no systematic reviews have been carried out on the use of EMA in STB. The aim of this study is to systematically review the evidence on the use of EMA in suicide research. Primary outcomes of interest were the characteristics and correlates of STB as explored through EMA. Secondary outcomes of interest were the feasibility and validity of EMA compared to other assessment methods. Methods This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines . Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria The inclusion criteria were as follows: i) Original studies published in peer-reviewed journals; ii) Studies with a sample size of five participants or more; and iii) Studies that employed EMA (also known as the experience sampling method, ESM) to explore the dynamics of STB, phenotypes of STB, correlates of STB, validity of EMA for STB assessment, and/or the feasibility of EMA for STB assessment. The following exclusion criteria were applied: i) Proofs of concept, protocols for randomized clinical trials, and other studies that did not provide measurable outcomes; ii) Case reports, case series, and systematic and nonsystematic reviews; and iii) Studies that explored non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) instead of STB. There were no restrictions regarding sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosis, or the clinical setting of the participants. No restrictions were placed as regards publication date. Publication language was limited to English or Spanish. Search Strategy We performed a systematic search of databases PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO. The last search date was July 2020. The search terms used were as follows: ""(Experience Sampling Method OR Ecological Momentary Assessment) AND suicide"", adapted to the syntax requirement of each database. The reference lists of eligible articles were manually reviewed to identify additional relevant publications. Study Selection and Data Extraction Articles were stored and screened using the online tool Rayyan QCRI . To determine study eligibility, two researchers (MLB and ASC) reviewed the papers independently. The full-text version of potentially eligible studies was independently assessed by the two reviewers. Discrepancies between the reviewers were discussed and resolved by consensus. Using pre-made tables, the following information was extracted: author and year of publication; country; study design; follow-up period and sample size and characteristics; aims of the study; measures collected through EMA; modality of EMA (paper and pencil; PDA; smartphone; other); app name in the case of smartphone-based EMA; participation rate (i.e., response to recruitment); retention rate; compliance with EMA questions; incentives; outcomes explored; EMA measures; frequency of EMA assessment; and main findings. Extraction was performed independently by the two abovementioned researchers. Discrepancies were discussed and resolved by consensus.  Results The initial search yielded a total of 544 articles. Following screening and full-text review, 35 publications were finally included in the review, representing 21 unique samples. Figure  shows the bibliographic search protocol. There was an increase in the number of publications over time. For the period spanning 2007 to 2016, we found nine publications, whereas from 2017 to 2020, we found 26 publications. Figure  illustrates the number of EMA publications by year of publication. Characteristics of the Reviewed Studies Tables  summarize the characteristics and main findings of the reviewed studies. Regarding the samples of the reviewed studies, six studies (four samples) were conducted in adolescent populations , while the rest were carried out in adults. Two studies were based on samples solely composed of women , while another used only men and was carried out among prison inmates . EMA assessment periods varied widely, ranging from 4 days   EMA was applied using four main formats. Seven studies, representing five unique samples, employed paper-based EMA along with an electronic device (such as a wristwatch) to notify participants as to when they should complete the assessments . Five studies (four unique samples) employed PDA-based EMA . Four studies (two samples) used web-based EMA, prompting participants via text message to complete the assessments . The remaining 19 studies (ten unique samples) employed smartphone-based EMA through a mobile application . One study that did not meet the inclusion criteria because it was a case series conducted EMA through daily phone calls . The frequency of EMA prompts varied across studies, ranging from one  to ten assessments per day . All studies scheduled the EMA prompts so as not to interfere with sleep. Four studies included some kind of passive collection of information in addition to active EMA: Littlewood et al. and Glenn et al. used wrist actigraphy to assess sleep  while Ben-Zeev et al. and Porras-Segovia et al. used native smartphone sensors to collect data on aspects such as mobility . Studies included in the review assessed different suicidal phenomena: 19 assessed passive SI , thirty-one assessed active SI , six assessed SA , and only three assessed suicide plans . No study included death by suicide as an outcome. Feasibility of EMA Six studies specifically investigated the feasibility and acceptability of EMA •], while others provided information on feasibility as a secondary outcome. Across all studies, retention rates ranged from 64.1%  to 100% . Compliance with EMA (i.e., percentage of EMA questions answered out of the total questions) ranged from 52%  to 89.7% . Most studies offered participants financial incentives that were proportional to their degree of compliance or were given to all who reached a minimum level of compliance . Glenn et al. explored the feasibility of EMA in adolescents and developed a safety protocol to monitor suicide risk during the study . In the satisfaction survey, performed at the end of the study, adolescents valued the overall experience with  EMA (mean rating: 3/4). Thus, if EMA scores rated above a pre-established threshold, participants were contacted. EMA was scheduled outside school hours as not to interfere with participants' daily activities. Risk was also monitored similarly to the study by Czyz et al., which also employed an adolescent sample and also found good acceptability rates among participants . Porras-Segovia et al. explored the feasibility of two EMA smartphone applications over a 2-month follow-up period: the MEmind, which administered an EMA questionnaire, and eB2, which gathered participants' data through the smartphone's native sensors, a concept also known as passive EMA. The study compared the use of these two applications in three populations: patients with a history of STB, patients without a history of STB, and student controls. Patients received no incentives, while student controls received academic credits. For passive EMA, the retention rate was significantly higher in patients with a history of STB. For active EMA, there were no significant differences between groups. Compliance with active EMA was significantly higher among student controls ]. One study explored whether asking about suicide through EMA had a harmful effect on patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). The study authors compared a group of patients who underwent a 2-week EMA assessment with another group that was not assessed. The group assessed through EMA did not experience an increase in STB, although they reported a slight negative impact on other BPD-related symptoms . Figure  shows a comparison of follow-up periods, retention rates, use of incentives, and EMA compliance across studies. Validity of EMA Four studies compared EMA to traditional assessments of STB . Ben-Zeev et al. compared EMA against retrospective recall of depressive symptoms in depressed inpatients and healthy controls. Discrepancies were found between EMA and retrospective recalls in both groups. In depressed patients, discrepancies consisted of an exaggerated number of symptomsincluding suicidality-in the retrospective recall, while in controls, discrepancies occurred in both directions . In the study by Gratch et al., 51 people with major depressive disorder were prospectively followed using EMA for 1  Characterization of STB Six studies focused on the dynamics of STB over time . Hallensleben et al. explored fluctuation and correlates of active and passive SI in 74 inpatients with MDD through a 1week EMA protocol. SI showed a wide within-person variability over time . STB-related constructs, such as suicide capability, also exhibited substantial fluctuation over short periods of time . Using paper-based EMA, Crowe et al. explored the withinday dynamics of passive SI, along with other symptoms, in depressed patients vs. controls. They found that depressed patients exhibited a higher variability in most symptoms, including SI . Kleiman et al. explored active SI in two samplesoutpatients and inpatients-using a 28-day, smartphonebased EMA program . They examined real-time fluctuations in SI and its risk factors and found that SI could vary widely over a few hours. Using these two samples, Kleiman et al. employed latent profile analysis to reveal distinct phenotypes of suicidal thoughts depending on their intensity and variability. There were five distinct phenotypes of SI. Phenotype number 4, characterized by severe and persistent SI, was associated with a higher probability of recent SA in outpatients, but not in inpatients . Correlates of STB Twenty of the reviewed studies explored different potential risk factors of STB . A good number of studies focused on the association between STB and different subdomains of affect . For instance, in the study by Victor et al., suicide urges were associated with both internalizing and externalizing negative affect , while in the study by Kleiman et al., hopelessness and loneliness were associated with concurrent, but not subsequent, active SI . The only study exploring the association between sleep and active SI was the one by Littlewood et al., who found a unidirectional association by which poor sleep quality and short sleep duration predicted more severe SI the next day . Some studies used EMA to investigate the environmental triggers of SI . Husky et al. found that participants were more likely to experience active SI in contexts such as solitude and feelings of sadness or anxiousness, or during family events .  found that in over 40% of cases, active SI appeared while the patient was alone . Discussion In this systematic review, we found a considerable number of studies that used EMA to explore STB, especially among those published in recent years. In fact, almost three-quarters of the studies included in our review were published over the last 4 years. Comparison With Previous Reviews This review supports the findings of other systematic reviews in related areas, which show that EMA is a promising methodology in suicidology. In their 2018 review, Rodriguez-Blanco et al. found 23 studies exploring the use of EMA in NSSI research. As in our review, most studies had a short follow-up period, in most cases no longer than 2 weeks. Rodriguez-Blanco et al. argued that studies should aim for longer follow-up periods . Kleiman and Nock's 2018 narrative review highlighted the usefulness of EMA for studying STB in real time, stressing the potential of EMA to improve short-term prediction. The authors also highlighted the need for studies with longer follow-up times and larger sample sizes . As for Chaïb et al.'s narrative review, which focused on the presence of sleep disturbances during suicidal crises, they only found two publications assessing the topic (only one met our inclusion criteria) and stressed the scarcity of studies exploring this topic, despite the potential of sleep as a clinical marker for STB . Evolution of EMA Study designs using EMA for data collection have changed over time. In the early days of EMA development, assessments were conducted using pencil and paper. This is an accessible and easy-to-use option that involves little expense. However, this method has several limitations: there is a risk of data collection errors, there is no reliable way of knowing if the participant has filled in the data at the right time, and it is inconvenient for patients to carry evaluation materials around with them . With the arrival of PDAs, some of the drawbacks of pen and paper were solved, but soon smartphones took over. In 2019, over 5 billion people owned a mobile device, and over half of these connections were smartphones . The increasing ownership and sophistication of smartphones is leading to increased use of these devices in studies, particularly as these devices are small in size and users tend to have them on their person at all times, and smartphones allow real-time uploading of data and can be used for purposes such as these at no additional expense, etc. The Potential of EMA to Study STB The articles reviewed have employed EMA in different ways to study the particularities of STB. Each of these approaches may in turn have important implications for clinical practice. Thus, studies that examined the dynamics of SI show us the great variability of SI over short periods of time, with changes occurring in a matter of a few hours. EMA offers us the possibility to record these changes and opens the door to real-time clinical monitoring of suicidal risk. EMA also offers new perspectives on suicide risk assessment. Most studies that explored the validity of EMA found important differences between EMA and the comparison test. Ben-Zeev et al. found that depressed patients tended to exaggerate symptoms on retrospective assessment . In contrast, the study by Torous et al. recorded more instances of SI by measuring it with real-time EMA as compared to subsequent retrospective assessment of the same periods . This was also the case in the studies by Czyz et al. and Gratch et al. Are these non-specific issues of imprecision motivated by recall bias, or is there difficulty in reporting SI in face-to-face assessments? Some research shows that patients may feel uncomfortable talking about their SI , or may have difficulties articulating their thoughts on this issue . This is part of the rationale behind the D/S Implicit Association Test (IAT), developed by Nock et al., which relies on patients' unconscious feelings about death and is showing promising results in suicide prediction . Though not a substitute for traditional assessments, non-face-to-face assessments and other novel methods of suicide risk assessment could represent a useful complementary tool. Feasibility of EMA As shown by the articles reviewed, EMA is generally well accepted by patients, with relatively high rates of retention and compliance. Although EMA appears to be a feasible method for the study of STB, it also has some drawbacks. Repeatedly assessing participants can lead to fatigue, which may influence compliance and retention. The meta-analysis by Vachon et al. found that average compliance in EMA studies was 78.7% and that this rate was affected by several factors. For instance, compliance was higher when assessments were more sparse, when there were fewer assessments per day, and when the incentives given to patients were greater . In our review, we have observed different strategies for decreasing the repetitiveness of EMA. For instance, studies tend to have short follow-up periods, many lasting no more than 1 week . Also, assessments were scheduled so that they did not interfere with patients' rest or daily activities. Another strategy is to introduce variation by rotating the questions, asking a few each day from a pool of several questions . Other researchers chose to send reminders to participants when their compliance started to decline  or to give users compliance-related feedback . Another strategy that complicates efforts to empirically determine the feasibility of EMA is the use of incentives, which were employed by a good number of the articles reviewed. Incentives make it difficult to draw conclusions about feasibility and for some authors they pose ethical conflicts . Moreover, some studies have been conducted in inpatient settings , whereas the interest of EMA lies in being used in real environment. Future Lines of Research One of the most promising lines of future research in EMA is passive monitoring of information, that is, without active collaboration of the user. Smartphones open up this possibility thanks to the native sensors included in the device. This concept, known as passive EMA, is beginning to be explored in a small number of studies in suicide research  and has been explored more widely in other areas of mental healthcare . Passive EMA does not allow direct assessment of STB, but it does make it possible to collect variables that could serve as clinical proxies of suicide risk factors, such as mobility, sleep, or smartphone use. Additionally, it may be useful for studying the context in which suicide ideation arises. The amount of information that can be collected through these systems increases as mobile technology advances and as passive EMA systems are complemented by wearable devices. Given the large amount of potentially sensitive information collected through this method, special care must be taken to protect personal data so as to ensure the privacy of participants. There are ethical concerns involved when developing digital tools for mental healthcare, and a proper balance must be reached between safeguarding patients' health and respecting their privacy . Another important line of related research is ecological momentary intervention (EMI), a modality of EMA with therapeutic intent that seeks to provide remote psychological support with 24/7 availability. EMI is already beginning to be explored in other areas of mental health, such as depression . Although EMI is a promising area, more clinical trials are needed to test the long-term effectiveness of these interventions before they can be implemented in clinical practice . Strengths and Limitations To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of the use of EMA for studying STB. Among the limitations of our review, it is worth noting the great heterogeneity of the studies (with different study populations, aims, and modalities of EMA), which has prevented a quantitative synthesis of the results. Conclusions EMA can reveal unknown features of STB by analyzing this complex phenomenon at a high level of detail. This methodology may facilitate the search for short-term predictors of STB and ultimately contribute to suicide prevention. EMA may become a very useful tool in clinical practice, and we should begin to test this approach in conditions as close as possible to real life. However, there are also ethical issues to be resolved, such as the strategy to follow when EMA detects that a patient has a high SI, adequate protection of patient privacy, or the regulation of mobile health within healthcare systems. Future studies will have to address these challenges over the coming years and integrate advances in new technologies to optimize the use of the EMA. "
