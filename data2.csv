0,0,Ecological momentary assessment of interpersonal theory of suicide constructs in people experiencing psychotic symptoms,"Background: People with psychotic disorders are at an increased risk of suicide, but there is little understanding of suicidal ideation (SI) in this population. The Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide posits that perceived burdensomeness (PB) and thwarted belonginess (TB) contribute to SI. To our knowledge there are no studies using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to assess these interpersonal risk factors in a sample of individuals with psychotic disorders. This study investigated the validity and variability of PB and TB, and whether SI, EMAmeasured psychotic symptoms, mood, and social context relate to PB and TB. Method: Ninety-six participants with a psychotic disorder, including mood disorders with psychosis completed inlab assessments of current SI, and then EMA surveys on a smartphone 3/day for 10 days, answering questions about burdensomeness, belongingness, symptoms (i.e., hearing voices, experiencing suspiciousness), mood (i.e., happy, sad), and social context. Results: Burdensomeness varied within-participants less than belongingness (t (95) = -3.74, p=< .001). Participants with SI had higher mean burdensomeness ratings (t (94) = -2.70, p < .01) and lower mean belongingness ratings (t (94) = 3.68, p < .001) than did participants without SI. Being with others, greater psychotic experiences, less happiness, and greater sadness related to greater burdensomeness. SI status, being alone, greater psychotic experiences, less happiness, and greater sadness related to less belongingness. Conclusions: This study examined the real-time influences of SI and psychotic symptoms on burdensomeness and belongingness. Hearing voices, suspiciousness, mood, and SI are related to interpersonal suicide-related risk factors. In this sample, social context had a differential effect on burdensomeness and belongingness.","[""Schizophrenia"", ""Schizoaffective disorder"", ""Bipolar disorder"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""EMA"", ""Suicide"", ""Psychosis""]",10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.06.022,
1,1,The after-effects of momentary suicidal ideation: A preliminary examination of emotion intensity changes following suicidal thoughts,"Research using ecological momentary assessments has highlighted the importance of negative emotions as predictors of day-to-day suicidal thoughts. Yet only one study has examined the real-time consequences of these thoughts. This preliminary investigation examined changes in emotion intensity following suicidal thoughts. It also explored associations between these changes and endorsement of suicide functions as an escape and/or as a solution, examined both as momentary thoughts and intractable beliefs about suicide. Thirty-nine community participants endorsing suicidal ideation were followed for two-weeks and completed multiple daily surveys related to suicidal thoughts, functions of suicide, and emotion intensity. Participants reported heightened emotion intensity immediately following a suicidal thought across six emotions, with delayed reductions in stress and anxiety following ideation onset. When assessed in the moment, suicide as a solution to a problem predicted increases in hopelessness, sadness, stress and general negative affect immediately following a thought, while suicide as an escape predicted increases in anger immediately after a thought. When measured as intractable beliefs, only stronger belief in suicide as a solution to a problem predicted delayed reductions in stress following ideation. Increased intensity of negative emotions immediately following suicidal ideation suggests a potential vicious cycle of heightened emotion intensity and suicidality.","[""Suicidality"", ""Experience sampling"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Real-time assessment"", ""Negative reinforcement""]",10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114027,
2,2,Across-subjects multiple baseline trial of exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for severe irritability: a study protocol,"Introduction Irritability is defined as a tendency towards anger in response to frustration. Clinically, impairing irritability is a significant public health problem. There is a need for mechanism-based psychotherapies targeting severe irritability as it manifests in the context of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). This study protocol describes a randomised multiple baseline design testing the preliminary efficacy of a new treatment, exposurebased cognitive-behavioral therapy for severe irritability in youth, which also integrates components of parent management training. We will investigate associations of this intervention with primary clinical measures, as well as ecological momentary assessment measures. Methods and analysis Forty youth will be enrolled. Participants, aged 8-17 years, must present at least one of two core symptoms of DMDD: abnormal mood or increased reactivity to negative emotional stimuli, with severe impairment in one domain (home, school, peers) and moderate in another, or moderate impairment in at least two domains. Each participant is randomised to a 2-week, 4-week or 6-week baseline observation period, followed by 12 active treatment sessions. Clinical ratings are conducted at baseline, biweekly (clinician), weekly (parent/child) throughout treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month and 6-month follow-up (clinician). Clinician ratings on the Affective Reactivity Index and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale for DMDD are our primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures include parent and child reports of irritability. Post hoc additional symptom measures include clinician, parent and self-ratings of depression, anxiety and overall functional impairment. Prospective, digitally based event sampling of symptoms is acquired for a week pretreatment, mid-treatment and post-treatment. Based on our pathophysiological model of irritability implicating frustrative non-reward, aberrant threat processing and instrumental learning, we probe these three brain-based targets using functional MRI paradigms to assess target engagement.

Clinically, impairing irritability is a significant public health problem,  and is among the most frequent presenting problems in youth psychiatric practice.  Longitudinally, irritability predicts depression, anxiety,  suicidality,  and is associated with functional impairment.  The need to diagnose address and treat youth with severe impairing irritability led to the inclusion of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th Strengths and limitations of this study ► This study protocol presents and tests a novel intervention to target core symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) symptoms (irritable mood, temper outbursts). ► This study protocol is employing parent management training (PMT) and principles of extinction derived from exposure therapy to target key mechanism of aberrant reward and threat processing, two core pathophysiologically informed dysfunctions posited in DMDD. ► The current protocol leverages state-of-the-art measures by collecting intensive, week-by-week clinical symptom data from patients, parents and trained clinicians, as well as behavioral and neural data from patients during the treatment. ► Despite the strengths and innovative aspects of the current study, the current multibaseline design is not a randomised controlled trial, therefore, it does not allow for strong causal inferences. ► The combination of both PMT and exposure techniques in the current treatment does not allow for separation of their effects. Open access edition (DSM-5). While this decision was somewhat controversial,  DMDD codifies clinically-significant temper outbursts and irritable mood. However, there is a need for additional evidence-based psychotherapies that specifically target the temper outbursts and irritable mood, the two core symptoms articulated in DMDD.  Coupled with this need, in recent years, there has been a movement towards treatment innovation based on engaging brain-behaviour targets that are hypothesised as translational mechanisms.  In this study, we test both clinical efficacy and target engagement of a cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) for severe irritability as it presents in DMDD. Only one prior treatment study targeting anger leverages pathophysiology to guide the treatment intervention.  Thus, additional mechanism-based, targeted interventions for DMDD are needed.  Biomarkers have transformed modern medicine but remain largely elusive in psychiatry. To date, treatments have either been serendipitous and/or developed primarily to address specific clinical symptoms. Augmenting this mechanism-driven approach, researchers    have suggested that experimental therapeutics should engage pathophysiological targets, while synergistically leveraging prior symptom-based theoretical approaches. Thus, here, we integrate and test mechanism-based approaches to target two core deficits in impairing irritability  : (1) aberrant reward processing and (2) aberrant threat processing. The inclusion of therapeutic techniques to target key mechanisms of irritability is intended to lead to more efficient, generalized and long-term outcomes.  Prior relevant treatments Some empirically supported interventions target irritability and disruptive behaviour as seen in disruptive behaviour disorders (DBD): attention-deficit\hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder. However, there are two opportunities to further build on this research. First, few existing interventions specifically target severe, impairing irritability and temper outbusts as present in the context of DMDD, which is a mood disorder as opposed to DBD.    Second, while there are a few categories of existing relevant empirically supported interventions: parent management training (PMT) and CBT for DBD, and dialectical behaviour therapy for preadolescent children (DBT-C) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) for DMDD, such treatments do not emphasise exposure techniques as a primary target. Meta-analytical evidence supports the efficacy of PMT in decreasing externalising behaviours, aggression, oppositionality and impulsivity characteristic of DBDs,  with a medium effect size for trials using blinded assessments.    For example, Parent-Child Interaction Therapy    is a manualized parent training intervention that has received substantial empirical support in the treatment of disruptive behaviour. Other interventions, such as the Incredible Years,  Stop now and Plan 36 and Kazdin's PMT,  are also evidence-based psychotherapies for externalising problems. However, most are targeted towards very young children  or target a broad spectrum of externalising problems.  Although some of these protocols include treating anger and aggressive outbursts  there is no protocol modified specifically to parents of youth with DMDD, potentially limiting the generalizability across symptom domains. Furthermore, studies of youth with ODD and ADHD have yet to systematically examine the effects of PMT on emotional symptoms, notably the irritable dimension.  PMT efficacy studies are needed to investigate the unique clinical and pathophysiological features of severe irritability in children and adolescents.  Early research suggests that youth with severe mood dysregulation show deficits during probabilistic response reversal and reversing previously rewarded associations.  It remains unknown whether PMT addresses such deficits in reward learning. CBT, which targets relationships among thoughts, behaviours and feelings,  has also shown efficacy in treating anger and disruptive behaviour.    Sukhodolsky et al  developed a CBT protocol for aggression using three modules: emotion regulation, social problemsolving and the social skills training aimed to prevent and resolve conflict situations. The first module starts with identifying anger triggers, developing prevention strategies and learning emotion regulation skills, such as cognitive reappraisal and relaxation training. The second module focuses on problem-solving skills, such as generating multiple solutions and considering different consequences and actions when dealing with conflicts. The final module focuses on developing skills for preventing or resolving potentially anger-provoking situations in different domains. In a meta-analysis of CBT for anger in youth, Sukhodolsky et al  reported a medium mean effect size across parent, teacher, observer and self-reports for physical aggression and/or delinquency in boys. Other meta-analyses and review papers examined the effect of evidence-based CBT/psychosocial treatments for disruptive behaviour or externalising disorders, showing mixed results for efficacy  ; however, the participants in those studies were not specifically referred for severe, impairing irritability. Although promising, such anger-based CBT protocols emphasise cognitive techniques (eg, generation of multiple solutions and the consideration of consequences for different courses of action in conflicts), rather than behavioral interventions. Several behavioral principles, such as exposure, might be explored in clinically irritable youth. Exposure techniques help patients to systematically approach aversive situations while resisting urges to avoid or escape. Such techniques teach patients to approach and tolerate triggering stimuli, despite their feared outcomes, using a graded hierarchy of exposure stimuli.    A recent promising clinical case report using the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children (UP-C)  demonstates a positive outcome in the treatment of a child with anger Open access and irritability.  UP-C, an emotion-focused transdiagnostic treatment for anger, consists of cognitive-behavioral techniques, encouraging patients to experience thoughts more mindfullly and neutrally. In a recent pilot study,  Hawks et al adapted the UP-C for the treatment of paediatric irritability in a sample of 19 children (ages  with primary presenting concerns of irritability and/or disruptive behaviours. Results supported the feasibility and acceptability of this treatment and provided preliminary evidence that such an approach may yield improved outcomes for symptoms of paediatric irritability and disruptive behaviours. Another recently published study by Evans et al  examined the effectiveness of a modular, transdiagnostic, behavioral/cognitive-behavioral intervention (MATCH), which is an existing flexible manual, for treating youth with severe irritability, compared with standard manualized treatments and usual care. Irritability was not specifically targeted in this larger study. MATCH showed the most consistent improvement in reducing irritability across multiple measurement schedules and informants. Taken together, the development and examination of expanded behavioral (eg, exposurebased) interventions targeting irritability requires further research, towards the goal of identifying active components effective in reducing irritability in youth with DMDD. In a complementary line of work, Perepletchikova et al  adapted DBT for preadolescent children (DBT-C), drawing from DBT  and its adolescent adaptation (DBT-A).  DBT-C provides youth and parents with skills training, coaching and therapy aimed to help families apply and generalize skills in mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, validation and behaviourism/reinforcement principles. An initial DBT-C randomised controlled trial (RCT) in a sample of youth with DMDD demonstrated efficacy.  At post-treatment assessment, following 32 weeks of DBT training, children reported a significant increase in adaptive coping skills and significant decreases in depressive symptoms and problematic internalising behaviours.  In additional work examining irritability in the context of mood disorders, a recent pilot RCT  assessed the feasibilty and preliminary efficacy of an adapted version of IPT for mood and behaviour dysregulation in youth with DMDD. Results indicated decreased outbursts and irritability and improved interpersonal interacting after treatment. In sum, paediatric adaptations of DBT and IPT show positive preliminary results in youth with DMDD. Collectively, accumulating evidence supports the efficacy of different treatment components of PMT, CBT, DBT and IPT in treating externalising behaviours, aggression, oppositionality, impulsivity and irritability across various diagnoses. This novel protocol intervention builds on prior treatments. First, the current protocol specifically targets youth's encoding of nonreward and threat stimuli in the context of frustration, and integrates approaches of CBT and PMT. Second, the current protocol emphasises in vivo behavioral exposure to anger-inducing stimuli, independent of skills training in the additional domains of distress tolerance, mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness and validation strategies. The current study The current protocol relies on a pathophysiological framework with the aim to implement CBT and PMT techniques to adress pathophysiological targets. Specifically, the intervention is capitalising on empirically supported and theory-driven interventions and posits two core mechanisms of impairing irritability: (1) exposure-based CBT to target exaggerated responses to frustrative nonreward and/or threatening stimuli and (2) PMT to target aberrant reward processing; with both mechanisms being mediated by abnormalities in frontoamygdalar circuitry. Some studies show that high irritability is associated with decreased activation in regulatory prefrontal regions during frustration,  and that these regions have a critical role in emotion processing by regulating activity of the amygdala.  Of note, regulation of amygdala activity by the prefrontal cortex seems to be one of the key mechanisms underlying exposure techniques.  Some evidence suggests that exposure might not be successful in treating proactive aggression  (representing predatory attacks motivated by external reward). However, irritability is characterised by reactive aggression,  meaning affectively driven aggressive responses to others' behaviour that is perceived as threatening or intentional. Here, we extend prior work by investigating CBT for chronic, severe and impairing irritability and temper outbursts. This CBT uses both in-session and betweensession in vivo exposures to anger-inducing stimuli as the primary behavioral technique. Previous evidence suggests that effective behavioral interventions targeting the threat system may also be applied to the treatment of anger-based disorders. Therefore, this protocol examines whether exposure to stimuli that evoke frustration and anger effectively reduces irritability. Similar to exposure therapy for anxiety and fear disorders, we conceptualise that exposure therapy will help severely irritable youth to increase their anger tolerance (without engaging in aggressive behaviours), decreasing manifestations of irritability, temper outburts and irritable mood. A novel aspect of the exposure work in the current study involves patient and therapist creating an anger hierarchy associated with different anger-inducing triggers for the patient. During therapy sessions, the therapist explicitly tries to evoke anger, before challenging the child to tolerate circumstances and demands, or to shape the environment to not acquiesce/reinforce. Our PMT intervention relies on the assumption that whether a child's difficulties in reward processing manifest through irritable behaviour is also dependent on the parental behaviours and parental contingency management. Hence, the current protocol consists of a modified PMT, including elements such as active ignoring and positive praise.  The incorporation of these PMT strategies aims to counteract deficits in frustrative non-reward Open access response and, in turn, improve the child's symptoms and distress.  An open pilot trial of exposure-based CBT procedures for DMDD demonstrated initial feasibility.  Preliminary results indicated a pre-treatment to post-treatment reduction in DMDD symptom severity, as measured by the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity and Improvement (CGI-S, CGI-I)  scale and the Clinician-Rated Affective Reactivity Index (CL-ARI).  This CL-ARI is a paediatric, semistructured interview assessing temper outbursts and irritable mood. In the open trial, independent raters were not blind to treatment status. The current protocol addresses this limitation, in which clinicians' expectations may bias results, by using a randomised, multiple baseline design that staggers treatment onset across individuals.  Multiple baseline study designs are commonly used in cases where the dependent variable is not expected to return to baseline after the treatment had been applied. This design has a few strengths including increased confidence that changes in outcomes are a result of the intervention, if those outcomes occur across cohorts. To this end, we designed a protocol focusing on 12 weeks of exposure-based CBT plus PMT. The first half of each session (30-45 min) involves the patient completing exposure exercises. Throughout the therapy, the work with the child focuses on exposure, generation of an anger hierarchy, and gradual in-session exposure, and includes motivational interviewing to address ambivalence regarding change. Sessions with parents (30-45 min) comprise psychoeducation on reward learning and parental contingency management; parents are coached to praise and acknowledge their child's adaptive behaviours, and to actively ignore maladaptive behaviours. Other PMT elements include giving commands, setting limits, increasing time spent on positive joint activities, and delivering intermittent rewards. In later sessions, the therapist works with the parents on how to tolerate their emotional distress in response to their child's irritability symptoms. In between sessions, child is practicing tolerating their own anger through exposure while the parents are asked to employ techniques and strategies they had learnt in sessions (See table 1A,B) and for more details). We expect, that over the course of the treatment, using exposure and PMT techniques, patients will have an increased ability to tolerate their own anger and frustration, and an increased ability to regulate their feelings and behaviours in the context of frustrative non-reward or threatening triggers manifested through a decrease in irritable mood and temper outbursts. Overall, we hypothesise that the treatment will lead to decreased irritability (decreased irritable mood and temper outbursts) in response to frustration and to an overall decrease in illness severity. Given the importance of examining target engagement in treatment studies,  we probe the hypothesised neural targets throughout the treatment based on our pathophysiological model of irritability.  Specifically, participants complete resting state and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging Open access (fMRI) scans at different time points. Three fMRI paradigms assessing frustration, attention to threat and reward learning, separately, are included.  These paradigms test two hypotheses. First, we hypothesise that pre-treatment patterns of neural task activation will differentiate responders and non-responders (i.e., predictors or moderators). In an exploratory manner, we examine if activation and behavioral dysfunction across tasks can be used to determine who is most likely to benefit from treatment. Second, we predict that clinical improvement from pre-treatment to post-treatment will be mediated by prefrontal, striatal and amygdala circuit changes (i.e., mediation).   METHODS AND ANALYSIS The current study investigates exposure-based CBT and PMT for chronic, severe irritability and temper outbursts as they present in DMDD. Procedures Informed consent and assent are obtained from parents and youth, respectively, after complete description of study procedures and prior to study procedures. All participants are advised that research is voluntary and that they may withdraw participation at any time. Participants and parents complete a pre-treatment clinical evaluation onsite before being enrolled in the protocol. A trained and licensed masters-level or doctoral-level clinician conducts interviews with the participants and parents. We screen participants and follow them for several months prior to randomisation; any medication changes must be made prior to randomisation. We communicate to the family and the community treatment provider that once the child is randomised, the regimen cannot be changed unless there is an acute clinical need. Once patient is enrolled in the study, the child's prescriptions are written by a National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) psychiatrist who is working with the study team.   with the additional DMDD supplement.  Additionally, based on record review and  Recruitment Table 1A Continued Open access interviews with the child and parent, the clinical research team must agree that if the child is in active treatment, the child's response to their current treatment is no more than minimal determined by a score of 3 or more on the CGI-S. Unless there is an acute clinical need, participants must have no planned changes in outpatient psychiatric treatment regimen, which can include any psychotropic medications and/or psychotherapeutic interventions, 2 weeks prior to enrollment and throughout the weeks of treatment and post-treatment assessment. Participants are excluded if the irritability symptoms are due to the direct physiological effects of a drug, or to a general medical or neurological condition. Additionally, participants who meet DSM-5 criteria, as assessed by the K-SADS-PL,  for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective illness, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), major depressive episode, or post-traumatic stress disorder, are also excluded. ASD exclusion is operationalized using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA),  the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS),  the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ)  and the Children's Communication Checklist-Second Edition (CCC-2)  Specifically, we use cut-off scores of >75 on SRS, >15 on SCQ and <-15 on CCC. When one of these scores is above cut-off, with a combination of a DAWBA score, that is, ≥4, the participant is excluded. Participants are not eligible if they exhibit active suicidality or any cardinal bipolar symptoms, such as elevated or expansive mood, grandiosity or inflated self-esteem, and\or decreased need for sleep. Participants with other comorbid psychiatric problems (e.g., ADHD, anxiety disorders, past major depressive disorder; MDD) are not excluded from participation in this study. Study design Forty youth meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. Table  provides a detailed schedule of enrollment and intervention as well as a list of each of the measures being collected at each time point in the trial timeline. Each participant undergoes a randomised baseline observation period of 2, 4 or 6 weeks, followed by active treatment, and finally, post-treatment and follow-up observation periods (at 3 months and at 6 months following treatment termination). The multiple baseline design of the study controls for overall effects of time and regression towards the mean.  Rating clinicians (table ) are blinded to randomisation status of the participant and the timepoint the participant is in the trial at the time of the rating to control for clinician expectations. Randomisation to the different baseline points is independent to whether or not participants completed IBT study prior to starting the current protocol. Follow-up clinician-reported, child-reported and parent-reported primary and secondary outcomes are obtained at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. All visits are at the NIMH. All participants receive the active treatment.  Twelve weekly sessions last 60-90 min in an NIMH outpatient clinic, with both individual and joint child and parent meetings. There is one primary clinician treating the youth. Therapeutic procedures engaged in sessions are outlined in table 1A,B).  available upon request The manual involves a variety of exposure-based CBT procedures, such as creating hierarchies of irritabilityinducing events, exposure exercises (e.g., role-play, in vivo and imaginal), and PMT techniques (e.g., praise/ acknowledgement, pleasant interactions and unexpected rewards).    The exposures and the modules in the PMT are designed to be flexibly delivered and tailored for the specific issues and anger-inducing triggers identified by the individual child and their parents; therefore, the PMT modules will be adapted to account for age differences and will address the most salient problem areas identified using parent feedback. The main clinical outcomes we plan to assess are changes in irritability and overall illness severity and improvement. Changes in irritability will be assessed biweekly by clinician raters. Illness severity will be assessed biweekly and improvement will be assessed at mid-treatment and posttreatment. Illness severity at the end of the treatment will be compared with pre-treatment severity to determine the treatment's impact on the patient's overall severity of illness and to ascertain a frequently used global designation of 'responder' status.  The secondary clinical outcomes that will be assessed are child-reported and parent-reported irritability assessed weekly, and in vivo ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measures of mood and impairment, assessed pre-treatment, mid-treatment and post-treatment. Post hoc additional symptom measures include clinician-rated depressive and anxiety symptoms and functional impairment assessed biweekly. Additional secondary child-rated and parent-rated clinical outcomes include depressive and anxiety symptoms and aggression reported at pretreatment and post-treatment. Modifications made due to COVID-19 Due to the circumstances of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, recruitment was paused for about 5 months (Mid-March to mid-August 2020). To accommodate the protocol, we are continuing to adhere to the manual and provide treatment remotely. For patients going through the trial when the stay-at-home orders started, we shifted to telehealth. Exposures continue to be conducted and, in some ways, have benefited from being able to use the home as context in the exposures and parents being more at home to use in the exposures. Scans had stopped since mid-March. Procedures for administration of clinical, child and parent report measures, as well as EMA, stayed similar as to the rest of the trial, with the exception of the presession ARI allowed to be collected up to 2 days before the session for the pre-session, and postsession alliance measures allowed to be collected almost a week after the session. Self-report and parent report measures require more effort to assure compliance as these are collected remotely and via technology as opposed to on site as  Open access Continued Open access before. For the clinician ARI, clinicians consider the new circumstances of virtual schooling and being more at home, when evaluating impairment at school, at home and with peers. To protect privacy and due to lack of feasibility, sessions are no longer being recorded. While attempting to both, address some of the mental health burdens brought on by the pandemic and being compliant with protocol modules, it is challenging to address all the additional pandemic-related mental health difficulties such as kids' outbursts being more severe or parents changing their parenting style due to elevated stress. The potential effect of the pandemic on the results will be tested during data analysis, comparing and/or controlling the two groups of kids recruited before and after the pandemic outbreak. Discontinuation/modification criteria The criteria for discontinuing the trial include the patients' request to discontinue or if the participant's condition worsens. All participants are informed that they may discontinue participation at their request at any time and for any reason and that they will not lose any benefits to which they are otherwise entitled. Also, if a participant's condition worsens to where it would be deemed unsafe or clinically inappropriate for participation to continue as determined by the clinical team, then participant will be withdrawn from the trial. The patient's own care providers in the community would be contacted to discuss immediate care. Patient and public involvement For 2 years prior to the development of the treatment, informal focus groups were conducted with children with severe irritability to assess the priorities, potential experience and preferences of the children and family for whom the treatment was being developed. Questions during these informal meetings centred around preferred goals of the treatment, what parents and children were willing to do (questions on burden to participant and motivation), and identification of appropriate language for communications with the public to increase recruitment and interest. The research team also engaged in discussions with community providers during local and national presentations. The feedback from families and clinical professionals were geared towards making the treatment more generalizable, acceptable, feasible and equitable for the patient population under study. Measures Table  provides a clinical assessment timeline. In addition, treatment constructs are summarised in table . Primary outcome measures include the CL-ARI  to measure changes in irritability and CGI-Severity (CGI-S)    and CGI-Improvement (CGI-I)  scales to measure overall illness severity and improvement, respectively. The CL-ARI is a 12 items semistructured interview for DMDD designed to be administered by a trained clinician (master's level or above) to parents and children. The CL-ARI total score is the weighted sum of three subscale scores: temper outbursts (range of 0-27), irritable mood between outbursts (range of 0-8) and impairment (range of 0-15). Items are scored on Likert scales. Temper outburst frequency is scored on a 5-point scale, separately for mild, moderate and severe outbursts (0=none, 4=more than one outburst every day). Temper outburst duration is scored on a 6-point scale (0=none, 5=60 min). The irritable mood frequency item has a  Open access 4-point scale (0=none, 3=four or more days). The irritable mood duration item queries whether irritable mood was present for most of the day (i.e., at least half the day with a yes/no response option), and is only completed if the irritable mood frequency rating is scored at the maximum score (3=four or more days). The irritable mood severity item has a 6-point scale (0=not present, 5=severe). Last, impairment is rated separately in three different settings (family, school, peers) on 6-point scales (0=none, 5=severe). CL-ARI had a good reliabilty (Cronbach'sα=0.89) and validity scores.  CGI-S is is a single-item, 7-point measure of overall DMDD severity (1=normal, 7=most extreme) over the past month. The CGI scales are commonly used in psychiatric clinical trials, for which they have established utility and reliability.  Secondary outcome measures include parent and child report of irritability (child-rated and parent-rated ARI).  Additionally, we probe other co-occurring phenotypes in study, using clinician ratings of depressive symptoms (Children's Depression Rating Scale),  anxiety symptoms (Paediatric Anxiety Rating Scale)  and functional impairment (Children's Global Assessment Scale).  Children and parents provide reports on the child's symptoms of anxiety (Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders-child, SCARED  ; and SCAREDparent,  , respectively), aggression (Modified Overt Aggression Scale),  and depression (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, MFQ).  All of these measures demonstrated good internal consistency and discriminant validity in previous studies. Finally, EMA measures, a form of real-time digitally based event sampling are obtained to augment clinical phenotyping procedures, in addition to traditional clinical rating data.  Parents and children are prompted by smartphones for 7 days, three times per day, to answer questions about child symptoms and outbursts (occurring both, 'at the time of the beep' and 'since the last beep'), and functional impairment, and corresponded parental responses. The effect of the treatment on EMA measures will be assessed. Data quality of all measures in this study is continually monitored and checked postcollection. Treatment process measures Adherence measures were developed for this study to assess therapist fidelity and competence. With informed consent and assent, all treatment sessions are video recorded or audio recorded. Following each session, therapists rate themselves on adherence measures, and external raters blind to clinical outcome complete additional, observer ratings based on the recordings. Therapists, patients, parents and independent raters also assess the therapeutic alliance following every session.    To improve adherence and minimise drift, group supervision facilitated by the developer of the treatment where the manual is reviewed is conducted weekly throughout the trial. Study therapists review each other's session recordings to provide feedback during supervision. Neuroimaging measures At pre-treatment, mid-treatment and post-treatment, participants complete resting state,  as well as a frustration fMRI task (Affective Posner (AP3)).  At pretreatment and post-treatment, participants complete a threat attention orienting task (Dot-Probe)    and an instrumental reward learning task (Carnival) that also includes a frustration induction. Finally, diffusion tensor imaging,  a structural neuroimaging measure of neural circuitry, is also collected pre-treatment to estimate the location, orientation and anisotropy of the brain's white matter tracts. Scans are completed within 3 weeks of pre-treatment (session 1) and post-treatment (session 12). To ensure that all participants have the same exposure to stimuli, participants who are unable or unwilling to scan (e.g., braces) complete these tasks behaviorally outside of the scanner. fMRI tasks AP3 Task This task models frustrative non-reward by inducing, and then violating, the expectation of reward during an attention orienting task (see figure  for task overview). The task is organised into three blocks consisting of a series of timed-response trials in which participants identify a target following a cue (i.e., Posner task).  At the end of each trial, children receive accuracy feedback, and, after the first block, win or lose money on each trial. On all trials, a black screen is presented between the target/ response and the feedback slide. During the first block, participants are told to respond as quickly as possible to the stimuli and that there is no reward or punishment, but they receive feedback on their accuracy. This block consists two non-frustration runs outside the scanner that set up the expectation for reward. During the second block, inside the scanner, participants are introduced to the monetary contingency and win or lose US$0.50 when they make a correct or incorrect response, respectively. The third block, inside the scanner, is the frustration condition, during which feedback is rigged such that 60% of correct trials are followed by negative feedback and a loss of US$0.50, and 40% of correct responses are followed by positive feedback and a gain of US$0.50. Trials in which participants make incorrect responses are followed by accurate feedback. Finally, fixation trials, during which participants focus on a fixation mark in the centre of the screen, are included to facilitate comparisons between brain activity during task trials following wining/losing. At the end of each block, participants are asked to report the valence of their emotional response and their level of frustration. The AP3 task  is a wellestablished task used in multiple studies, including in the context of DMDD,  to investigate the circuitry mediating frustration. Previous studies demonstrate that in response to negative feedback received in the context of frustration, children with severe, chronic irritability are showing abnormal activations in regions implicated in emotion, attention, and reward processing. Open access Dot-Probe Task This task measures threat-related attention orientation. There is an expanding literature using this task showing threat-related  attention bias in samples with high levels of anxiety and irritability. To date, fMRI research using the dot-probe task yields generally consistent findings of individual differences in anxiety related to perturbed function in brain regions supporting emotional processing (e.g., amygdala) and attentional control (e.g., ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, vlPFC; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dlPFC).  In the current study, participants complete a faces-based variant of the dot-probe task,  (following the TAU-NIMH ABMT Initiative protocol (http:// people. socsci. tau. ac. il/ mu/ anxietytrauma/ research/). The task includes 120 trials: 80 threat-neutral and 40 neutralneutral (see figure  for task trial (see figure  for task overview). In each trial, a pair of faces appears following a fixation cross. Following the face display, a probe appears on the screen (i.e., '<' or '>') in the location of a previously viewed either neutral (i.e., incongruent trials) or threatening face (i.e., congruent trials). Participants are instructed to indicate the orientation of the probe by clicking the left or right button of a button box. The probe remains on screen until a response is registered, and then the next trial begins. Attention bias to threat scores are calculated from reaction times (RTs) on the threat-neutral face display trials by subtracting congruent trial RTs from incongruent trial RTs.  Positive attention bias to threat scores reflect a bias towards threat; negative scores reflect a bias away from threat. The Dot-Probe task starts with a resting state phase measuring pre-task brain activity at rest.   Carnival task This task is designed to examine reward vs loss learning in relation to irritability, both at baseline and following an acute frustration induction, and to investigate neural substrates involved in these processes. There are no previous studies examining reward learning per se in the context of DMDD. Related studies showed striatal dysfunction in the context of reward learning as compared with healthy youth.  Youth with conduct problems, showed   et al (2009) that is available to the public. We followed the terms and conditions listed for using the set and agreed to use the images for research purposes only. The manuscript includes models that are listed as ones which are permitted to be published in scientific journals (see this link for more details: https://www. macbrain.org/resources.htm). Open access atypical modulation of striatal activity based on stimulus expected value.  The task simulates a set of Carnival games and has three phases (see figure  for task overview). In the first and last phases, participants view pairs of objects on the left and right sides of the computer screen, respectively. The paired stimuli are in different colours, and switch their location on the screen randomly. Participants hold a grip force response device (dynamometer) in each hand, and grip one of the devices while the stimuli are on the screen in order to select that stimulus in an attempt to obtain a monetary reward (US$0.50). After participants respond, the screen acknowledges their selection by showing an image of a mallet overlaid on the selected stimulus. Next, a feedback screen appears indicating whether the selected stimulus is rewarded: 'Win 50¢!' or 'No Win.' During this phase, participants learn over the course of three different sets of paired stimuli to select the stimulus that is followed more frequently by reward. In the second or middle phase, participants view images on the screen that simulate a whack-a-mole game. For 40% of participants' correct responses, the selection is followed by a reward ('Win 50¢!'). For the other 60% of correct responses, feedback is rigged, or followed by no reward ('No Win'). Incorrect responses are always followed by no reward. All images are original to the task. At the end of each phase, participants rate their levels of frustration, excitement and unhappiness.  Baseline assignment Baseline assignment sequence is created via a computerbased random number generator. Randomisation is performed in blocks of 10 participants with a 1:1 ratio within blocks. Rating clinicians are blind as to the current trial phase at time of ratings, as well as the baseline condition assignment. The blind is not broken for the entire cohort until completion of the trial. Sample size and power analysis The sample size of this study is expected to include N=40 completers. To account for dropout, we have determined the total sample size of enrolment to be N=60. Medium to large effects (d=0.6-1.2) were detected in the pilot treatment conducted in our group using the current manual.  There is no standard power analysis for multiple baseline designs. However, prior studies using this design with similar effect sizes generally have enrolled 6-18 participants.  Various meta-analyses estimate the effect size of the psychological treatment/psychological placebo difference to be 0.40-0.60.  A sensitivity-power analyses using G*Power v3.1 showed that with 40 participants, an error rate of 0.05 and a power of 0.95, a large effect size of d=0.81 is required, using within-subjects analyses, while accounting multiple comparisons corrections.  Since in the current study all participants receive an active treatment, we expect the effect size to be above and beyond placebo effect reported in the literature, and to be large in magnitude. We will use intention-to-treat analyses for noncompliance and missing outcomes, using last observation carried forward approach.   Data analysis We will test the null hypothesis of no difference in DMDD symptoms improvement between time points across the randomised baseline schedules. Both visual inspection Open access of the data and multilevel modelling in which repeated trials are nested within each subject will be used.  Mixed models will be performed to examine symptom change over time for each of the ARI measures (clinician, child and parent rated) and the clinician-rated anxiety and depressive symptom measures. The slopes of the baseline phase will be modelled and compared with the slopes of the treatment phase to identify differential slopes between phases. Effect sizes will be calculated to assess if the treatment is associated with symptom improvement in clinician-rated severity of illness and functioning, and parent and child rated anxiety, depression and aggression. In addition to calculating statistical significance for all inferential tests, we will calculate clinically significant change for ARI measures and secondary outcome measures, using the method recommended by Jacobson and Truax.  CGI-I, a measure of improvement, will also be used to determine clinical change. For EMA ratings, we will use multilevel modelling to evaluate a pre-to-post-treatment increase in parental rewards for adaptive child behaviour, and decrease in rewards for irritable behaviour. Although the current design does not allow us to measure adjunctive versus separate effects of PMT vs exposure, based on sessions recording, we will calculate the dosage of each intervention at the individual level, and measure associations between intervention type proportion and treatment efficacy/clinical change. fMRI analyses will test for pre-treatment vs post-treatment differences in frontostriatal engagement after frustrative nonreward (AP3 and Carnival) and in frontostriatal-amygdala engagement during threat processing (Dot-probe). For each task, fMRI analysis will also compare pre-treatment and post-treatment resting state connectivity. For the AP3 task, we will compare activation on the N+1 trial after rigged versus positive feedback. The AP3 task will also be used to examine whether neural changes at mid-treatment predate or mediate clinical symptom change at post-treatment. Resting state data will explore changes in default mode, attentional and salience networks over the course of treatment. For each task, we will calculate separateanalyses of variance for CGI-I and CL-ARI to test post-treatment ratings × task condition × time (scan 1, 2) interactions. The model for CL-ARI will covary pre-treatment ratings. ETHICS To participate, parents must give written informed consent and the children must provide written assent. The research project and all related materials were submitted and approved by the appropriate IRB of the NIMH, which deemed the study to involve minimal risks. Adverse experiences include mild psychological distress and discomfort when responding to interview questions or questionnaires, engaging in the exposure-based treatment, or boredom during scanning or tasking. The principal and associate investigators monitor patients closely (e.g., at least weekly) throughout their participation in the study. Data management and monitoring Questionnaires and clinical ratings' data are managed through an IRB-approved password-protected institutional secure database, NIH Clinical Trials Database.

3,3,An Ecological Momentary Assessment of College Women's Decisions to Use Protective Behavioral Strategies,"Protective behavioral strategies (PBS) have been associated with reduced risk for sexual assault victimization in college women. Sexual assault risk reduction programs have had limited success increasing PBS use, particularly among heavy drinkers, suggesting a need for additional research on the malleable predictors of PBS use. Whereas longitudinal studies show women's decisions to use PBS can be both planned and reactive, little is known about the decision-making processes that affect PBS use on drinking days, when sexual assault risk may be elevated. The current study used ecological momentary assessment to examine variability in the associations between decision-making and PBS use within and across drinking days in first-semester college women. Participants (56 female drinkers) completed a 14-day protocol with three daily measures of intentions and willingness to use PBS, and once-daily diaries of PBS use. Multilevel models examined between-day and within-day effects of intentions and willingness to use PBS with regards to sexual assault PBS (e.g., communicating sexual boundaries) and drinking PBS (e.g., limiting alcohol consumption), respectively. On days when sexual assault PBS willingness increased throughout the day, women tended  to  use  more  sexual  assault  PBS.  This  association  was  strongest  among  women  who  were  typically  less  willing  to  use  these  PBS.  Among  women who were the least willing to use drinking PBS, their drinking PBS use decreased  on  days  when  they  reported  increased  willingness  to  use  them.  Decisions  to  use  sexual  assault  and  drinking  PBS  on  drinking  days  were qualified by women¡¯s typical levels of willingness to use the different PBS.  This  suggests  the  need  for  a  multi-faceted  intervention  strategy  that  targets both typical and event-level risk. Individual-level alcohol and sexual assault risk reduction approaches could be enhanced with event-level PBS messaging and evaluation","[""ecological  momentary  assessment"",  ""protective  behavioral  strategies"",  ""sexual  assault risk"", ""alcohol consumption"", ""college women""]",10.1177/08862605211005143,"Nearly one quarter of college women experience sexual assault in the United States . Risk for victimization is particularly high among younger students (i.e., those under the age of 21) who engage in heavy episodic drinking (HED; i.e., consuming four or more drinks on a single occasion; . Even women who typically consume less are at increased risk on days when they consume more than their typical amounts . The underlying mechanisms that explain the association between alcohol and sexual assault risk are well-established and multifaceted (see . Studies show that men perceive intoxicated women to be more sexually available or interested ; women who are drinking heavily also have a delayed recognition of and response to sexual assault risk. As such, perpetrators may be more inclined to prey on women who are drinking. Although sexual assault risk only exists in the presence of a perpetrator, alcohol is involved in over 50% of sexual assaults that occur on college campuses , warranting prevention strategies that address alcohol-related risk . Sexual assault risk reduction programs are an integral component of comprehensive prevention efforts and address multiple risk and protective factors . Risk reduction programs assert sexual assault is always the perpetrator's fault and also empower women to minimize the likelihood they will be targeted as a potential victim . A core mechanism of this prevention approach has been to increase use of sexual assault protective behavioral strategies (PBS; . Sexual assault PBS include strategies for setting and communicating personal boundaries (e.g., determining in advance what one is willing to do in a sexual situation) and deterring harm in situations where sexual assault risk may be present (e.g., walking home with trusted friends, being prepared to use forceful verbal or physical resistance strategies if necessary; . Several attempts have been made to tailor this risk reduction approach for heavy drinking women . These programs have typically expanded the discussion of PBS to include drinking PBS, which aim to limit alcohol consumption (e.g., consuming no more than one drink per hour; planning not to exceed three drinks in a night) or modify the manner of drinking (e.g., alternating alcohol and non-alcoholic beverages; avoiding shots) to minimize the potential negative effects of intoxication . Whereas sexual assault PBS have been directly associated with decreased sexual assault victimization in college women , drinking PBS have been indirectly associated with fewer incidents of forced and unwanted sex by first reducing alcohol consumption . Several rigorous evaluation studies of risk reduction programs have reported significant effects on sexual assault victimization (e.g.,  and alcohol-involved sexual assault, specifically . Program impacts on PBS use have been less consistent, especially in samples of heavy drinkers . This gap could be a function of measurement specificity. Prospective evaluation studies measure typical PBS use averaged over several months . This level of measurement does not account for whether or how women tailor their PBS use in response to interpersonal or contextual risk on a given day. Existing programs may also be insufficiently addressing the upstream factors that motivate an individual to use PBS . Relatively little is known about the processes that inform women's decisions to use PBS, and no studies have examined these processes on days when women drink and may be at increased risk for victimization. A better understanding of the malleable constructs that inform PBS use on drinking days is needed to enhance prevention efforts. Decisions to Use PBS Research shows women's decisions to use PBS can be complex, operating through core processes that are both planned (i.e., intentional) and emotionally reactive (i.e., one's willingness to use PBS based on the social situation; . Studies reveal that intentions and willingness tend to be positively associated, but when examined simultaneously, they each account for significant unique variance in predicting behavioral outcomes (e.g., .  observed women's intentions and willingness were positively correlated with each other (r = .78), but each accounted for unique and significant proportions of variance in predicting future sexual assault PBS use. The role of intentions in PBS use is consistent with prior literature that has shown positive health behaviors (e.g., healthy eating) tend to be more intentional or planned compared to health risk behaviors (e.g., substance use), which tend to be more reactive . Studies such as these tend to examine associations between intentions/willingness assessed at one time and behavioral outcomes assessed a month to several months later. The limitation of this approach is that it does not account for situational changes in decision making or PBS use. The current study attempted to fill this gap by examining event-level intentions and willingness to use PBS and behavioral outcomes on days when women might be at increased risk for victimization. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is an event-level methodology that allows for repeated measurement of events, experiences, or behaviors as they occur in real time and in participants' natural environments . The EMA approach provides a method to examine the answers to more nuanced process-based questions, such as: (a) Does the influence of decision-theoretical constructs (intentions and willingness) on PBS use vary from day to day? (b) Does the influence vary within a day leading up to a drinking event? (c) Is the influence of within-or between-day variability affected by individuals' typical decision-making patterns? Answers to these questions could provide insight into factors that decrease risk on a given day and inform the optimal timing and theoretical targets for interventions. For example, observed variability in the influence of intentions on PBS use from one day to the next might suggest existing risk reduction programs could be enhanced by encouraging women to consistently plan for what PBS they might use when they go out. Alternatively, observing variability within a day (e.g., if PBS use becomes more likely as intentions increase throughout the day) might suggest the need for supplemental event-specific interventions that make PBS use seem appealing right before or throughout a night out. Understanding these processes can help inform the nature of prevention efforts to increase overall PBS use, empower women to think about which PBS may be most beneficial in different situations, and subsequently reduce harm. The Current Study The current study used a 14-day EMA design to examine decision-making constructs associated with sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS. To understand the decision-making processes women use on days when they could be at increased risk for victimization, the current study examined PBS used only on drinking days. Further, drinking days are plausible and easily identifiable targets for intervention, both globally and at the event-level. Research suggests that, on average, women use more sexual assault PBS when they have greater intentions and willingness to do so . The current study aimed to explore these associations at the event level for both sexual assault and drinking PBS by answering the following research questions (RQ): (a) Do women use more sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so are higher than normal (e.g., withinperson/between-day effects)? (b) Do women use more sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so increase throughout the day, relative to when they decrease or stay the same (e.g., within-day effects)? (c) Do event-level associations between PBS use and decision-theoretical constructs vary based on one's average overall levels of intentions and willingness (e.g., between-person by within-person interaction effects)? These hypothesized associations were tested separately for sexual assault and drinking PBS because they may require unique intervention approaches for increased use. The effects of intentions and willingness were examined simultaneously (e.g., the effect of willingness controlling for one's average level of intentions) because previous research has identified both as being integral and complementary in the behavioral decision-making process . Answers to these questions will provide critical insight into how typical risk reduction approaches might be enhanced to address HED and event-level risk. Method Recruitment A random sample of 750 women was selected from the university registrar's database of incoming students at a large, public northeastern university. Students received personalized introductory letters and email invitations describing the study and containing a URL and PIN for accessing a consent form and brief web-based screening survey. Non-respondents received up to seven personalized email reminders. Approximately, 58% (n = 436) enrolled and completed the screening, resulting in a response rate comparable to other studies using similar web-based recruitment methods with new students transitioning into the university (e.g., . Over half of enrolled students met eligibility criteria (54%; n = 235), which included (a) having a 4G network smartphone and (b) reporting at least one heavy drinking episode in the past month (i.e., consuming four or more drinks on a single occasion; . Ineligible students were paid $5 and removed from the participant list. Eligible students were directed to the baseline assessment and paid $15 for their time. Students also earned a $5 rapid completion bonus if they completed the survey within 3 days of the initial invitation. EMA Study Procedures Following baseline assessment, two-thirds of participants (n = 156) were randomly selected for the EMA study; the remaining third was assigned to a reactivity control group. Students assigned to the current study were directed to a scheduling tool and invited to continue in the study by signing up for a required training on Snap Mobile, a mobile phone application used for daily data collection. Research staff made up to two phone calls and sent three additional emails to follow up with eligible students who did not schedule electronically or to reschedule participants who missed their scheduled session; participants also received text message reminders the night before their selected training session. Approximately, 54% (n = 84) of those invited, or 19% of all screened participants, attended training and enrolled in the EMA study. There were no significant differences between students who enrolled and students who did not enroll on age, race/ethnicity, baseline drinking, or PBS use (all ps > .05). The current study employed a 14-day event-and signal-contingent EMA protocol. Upon waking each morning, participants logged into their Snap Mobile app to complete a short survey of the previous day's drinking and PBS use. At the end of this morning survey, participants also completed their first prospective momentary assessments of intentions and willingness to use PBS on that day. Two additional momentary assessments of intentions and willingness occurred randomly between 2:00 pm and 6:00 pm and between 7:00 pm and 11:00 pm each day. Text message reminders were sent at 9:00 am on weekdays/10:00 am on weekends, and again at 12:30 pm for daily diaries (the survey closed at 1:00 pm daily); reminders for the afternoon and evening momentary assessments were sent 30 minutes before each survey period closed. Participants received $30 for participation, with a $20 bonus if they achieved at least 90% compliance on the daily morning assessments. To further encourage compliance, participants were entered into a lottery for each survey they completed; five lottery winners were randomly selected at the end of the study, with prizes ranging from $50 to $250. All study procedures were reviewed and approved by the university's Institutional Review Board. Participants Only the days on which participants reported drinking were included in analyses, as the current study aimed to understand PBS use on drinking days. The final sample included 56 participants who reported at least 1 drinking event during the 14-day assessment period with corresponding momentary data from the prior day. The mean age of the sample was 18.05 years (SD = 0.23). Most participants identified as Caucasian (82.1%), although other racial/ethnic backgrounds were represented (10.7% African American, 5.4% multiracial, 5.5% Hispanic). All participants lived on campus, and many intended to join intramural/club sports (55.4%) or sororities (42.9%) in their first semester. At baseline, participants reported consuming an average of 8.71 (SD = 6.06) drinks per week. Measures PBS If participants reported drinking the day/night before, within their daily waking recall assessments, they were asked to indicate which, if any, PBS they used (1 = Yes; 0 = No). For both types of PBS, briefer versions of established scales were used to keep daily assessments short and minimize response burden . The sexual assault PBS measure included six items from the Dating Self-Protection Against Rape Scale . Items were selected based on preliminary work identifying the types of behaviors women tend to use most frequently . Sample items included, ""Letting a friend or family member know where you are,"" and ""Walking home with a trusted friend."" A summed score was created to indicate the number of sexual assault PBS used on each drinking occasion. The drinking PBS measure included six items from the Protective Behavioral Strategies Scale . Items with factor loadings of at least 0.65  were selected from each subscale, including Stopping/Limiting Drinking (e.g., determined in advance not to exceed a set number of drinks), Manner of Drinking (e.g., avoided trying to keep up with or out drink others), and Serious Harm Reduction (e.g., tried to know where my drink was at all times). A summed score was created to indicate the number of drinking PBS used on each drinking occasion. Behavior-specific Intentions Each of the three daily momentary assessments asked participants about the activities they intended to engage in later that day. They were asked, ""Do you 'intend' to engage in any social activities today/tonight?"" (1 = Yes; 0 = No) and ""Do you 'intend' to drink?"" (1 = Yes; 0 = No). If drinking intentions were affirmed, participants also indicated which, if any, PBS from the lists above they intended to use (1 = Yes; 0 = No). Summed scores were created to indicate the number of sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS participants intended to use within each drinking occasion. Behavior-specific Willingness Similar to intentions, participants were presented with willingness questions specific to each behavior. They were asked, ""Are you 'willing' to engage in social activities tonight, should the opportunity arise?"" (1 = Yes; 0 = No) and ""Are you 'willing' to drink?"" (1 = Yes; 0 = No). If affirmed, participants indicated which sexual assault and drinking PBS they were willing to use (1 = Yes; 0 = No). Summed scores indicated the number of sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS participants were willing to use on each occasion. Analytic Strategy A series of four multilevel regression models were estimated in SAS (v. 9.4) to examine within-person/between-day effects (RQ1), within-day effects (RQ2), and cross-level interaction effects (RQ3; between-person X withinperson/day) of decision-theoretic constructs (intentions and willingness) on daily PBS use. Prior to analysis, waking recall assessments of the prior day's PBS use were lagged by one day and merged to match with the previous day's momentary assessments of intentions and willingness. Because predictor variables were assessed at a lower level (within day) than the outcome variables (between day), the lower level data (three momentary assessments of intentions and willingness within a day) were aggregated . Within-day aggregation was conducted in two ways to answer unique research questions. First, all three momentary assessments were averaged to create a day-level mean for intentions and willingness to use sexual assault and drinking PBS, respectively (RQ1). The second aggregation method created behavior-specific change scores ) by subtracting intention and willingness values reported at the first assessment within each day from the value reported at the third assessment within each day (RQ2). Positive values indicated an increase in intentions or willingness throughout the day, whereas negative values indicated a decrease. Missing data within the final analytic sample were handled using Full Information Maximum Likelihood , and outcome-specific unconditional means models confirmed the utility of the intended multilevel approach. The first set of models examined whether daily intentions and willingness to use PBS predicted actual PBS use on a given drinking day. Each behavioral outcome (sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS) was regressed onto behavior-specific day-level means of intentions and willingness. For example, sexual assault PBS use was regressed onto day-level means of intentions and willingness to use sexual assault PBS. To separate within-and betweenperson effects, predictors were group-mean centered at Level 1 (i.e., centered around the individual's mean) and grand-mean centered at Level 2 (i.e., centered around the sample mean). A second set of models examined whether within-day changes in intentions and willingness to use PBS predicted PBS use on a given drinking day. Again, using separate models for sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS, each behavioral outcome was regressed onto behavior-specific within-day changes in intentions and willingness to use PBS at Level 1 and grand-mean centered intentions and willingness to use PBS at Level 2. Within each model, we estimated both main effects (RQ1 & RQ2) and within-domain cross-level interactions (e.g., Level 1 intentions × Level 2 intentions; Level 1 willingness × Level 2 willingness; RQ3). Results Participants provided 368 total assessments (M = 6.57/person). Intraclass correlation coefficients from the unconditional means models indicated .85 of the variability in sexual assault PBS and .78 of the variability in drinking PBS occurred between-persons, leaving 15% and 22% of the variability, respectively, to be accounted for at the event-level. Results from the multilevel models predicting both sexual assault and drinking PBS are included in Table . For each outcome, results of RQ1 (between-day effects of intentions and willingness) are presented in the top panel and results of RQ2 (withinday changes in intentions and willingness) are presented in the bottom panel. The cross-level interaction terms within each panel (Rows 6, 7, 12, and 13) represent results for RQ3. Each will be discussed in turn. On any given drinking day, assuming average levels of PBS intentions and willingness, women used 2.76 (SE = 0.12) sexual assault PBS and 2.90 (SE = 0.17) drinking PBS (Table , Row 1). The main effects of daily intentions and willingness to use PBS on PBS use were not significant for either outcome (Rows 4 and 5). Thus, there was no evidence to suggest women used more sexual assault PBS or drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so were higher than normal. RQ2: Do Women Use More PBS on Days When Their Intentions and Willingness to Do So Increase Throughout the Day? Consistent with the first set of models, on any given drinking day, and assuming average intentions and willingness, women used 2.76 (SE = 0.13) sexual assault PBS and 2.74 (SE = 0.19) drinking PBS (Table , Row 8). There was a positive association between within-day changes in willingness and sexual assault PBS use (Row 12), such that at average levels of intentions, each 1-unit increase in willingness was associated with a 0.15 (SE = 0.06) increase in PBS use. In other words, women reported their highest sexual assault PBS use on days when their willingness to use sexual assault PBS increased throughout the day. Within-day changes in intentions to use sexual assault PBS were not significantly associated with sexual assault PBS use (Row 11). There were no significant associations between within-day changes in intentions and willingness and drinking PBS use (Rows 11 and 12). RQ3: Do Event-level Associations Between PBS Use and Decision-theoretical Constructs Vary Based on One's Average Overall Levels of Intentions and Willingness? Sexual Assault PBS Across both models, and consistent with global theories of behavior change (e.g., , the between-person effects of both intentions and willingness to use sexual assault PBS were positively associated with number of PBS used (Table , Rows 2, 3, 9, and 10). Individuals who reported greater intentions and willingness to use sexual assault PBS, on average, also reported using a greater number of sexual assault PBS, compared to individuals who reported lower average intentions and willingness to use sexual assault PBS. Building on this work, RQ3 examined whether event-level associations between PBS use and decision-theoretical constructs vary based on one's average overall levels of intentions and willingness. The between-person by daily average interactions were not significant (Rows 6 and 7), suggesting the non-significant event-level associations described above (RQ1) were consistent across all women in the sample; they did not vary based on one's typical levels of intentions and willingness. However, the between-person by withinday change interaction was significant for willingness to use sexual assault PBS (Row 14), suggesting the positive association between within-day changes in willingness and sexual assault PBS use (RQ2 above) might vary depending on one's typical willingness to use sexual assault PBS. To probe the nature of this interaction, the interaction was graphed in Figure . Separate lines are used to indicate the within-day association among individuals who reported (a) average (mean), (b) above-average (1 SD above the mean), and (c) below-average (1 SD below the mean) levels of overall willingness to use sexual assault PBS. The interaction was further probed by calculating the simple slopes and region of significance for each of the three between-person levels of sexual assault PBS willingness . Women who had average and below-average levels of overall willingness to use sexual assault PBS reported increased sexual assault PBS use on days when their willingness to use those PBS increased throughout the day (p < .01). This association was not significant for women with overall above-average levels of sexual assault PBS willingness; these women used the highest number of sexual assault PBS regardless of any within-day fluctuations in willingness. Drinking PBS. Across both models, the between-person association (Level 2) between willingness to use drinking PBS and PBS use was significant (Table , Rows 3 and 10), suggesting that individuals who, on average, reported willingness to use more drinking PBS also reported using a greater number of drinking PBS over the period of assessment. There was a significant cross-level interaction of between-person by daily average willingness to use drinking PBS (Row 7), suggesting that even though no event-level association between willingness and drinking PBS use was found when we examined main effects (RQ1 above), there may be an event-level association for certain individuals. Further probing (see Figure ) revealed individuals who, on average, reported the lowest overall level of drinking PBS willingness (i.e., below-average) decreased their PBS use on days when they reported more than their typical amount of willingness to use drinking PBS (p < .05). The simple slopes for the other between-person levels of drinking PBS willingness (i.e., average and aboveaverage) trended in the expected direction but were not significant. No other significant interaction effects were observed; intentions did not predict drinking PBS use at any level. Figure Effects of Between-Person Drinking PBS Willingness on the Association Discussion The current study aimed to enhance existing risk reduction programs by examining event-level variability in the decision-making processes that influence PBS use using an EMA study design. First, we examined whether women used more sexual assault and drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so were higher than normal. Findings did not support this hypothesis. This was surprising, as previous work indicates women regularly use a number of sexual assault PBS already , suggesting they are generally aware of social and environmental risks. One notable difference from this prior work was that our study focused solely on women in their first semester of college. These women may still be learning about social and environmental risk factors, suggesting a need to understand how PBS use and motivations for use differ between first year students and their more senior counterparts. At the event-level, specific contextual factors may impact women's risk perceptions and, in turn, their decisions to use sexual assault PBS on a given day. Women tend to be less willing to use sexual assault PBS in situations where they are socializing with someone they know because they do not think of that person as a potential perpetrator . Students may also be less willing to use drinking PBS if they have competing intentions to drink, as drinking PBS focus on limiting alcohol consumption. This effect might be heightened by affiliation with groups that support a heavy drinking culture (e.g., athletic teams, Greek life). Future event-level studies of PBS decision making should examine the role of contextual factors, such as with whom and in what environments women socialize, and between-person differences that might further explain event-level processes. Next, we asked whether women used more sexual assault and drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so increased throughout the day relative to days when their intentions and willingness decreased or stayed the same. Whereas no significant findings were observed for drinking PBS, women reported their highest sexual assault PBS use on days when their willingness to use sexual assault PBS increased throughout the day. This might suggest that women adjust their sexual assault PBS as they coordinate with friends or learn more about their plans through the day (e.g., where they are going, who they will see). Future research should explore what factors impact shifts in sexual assault PBS willingness, as well as between-person differences in who adjusts their willingness and PBS use versus those who do not. Interventions might be enhanced by encouraging women to learn as much as possible about the events they plan to attend (e.g., where they are going, what could happen in that setting) so they can proactively consider which PBS they might be willing to use in each situation. The third research question examined whether event-level associations between PBS use and willingness and intentions varied based on individuals' average levels of willingness and intentions. Consistent with global theories of behavior change and prior PBS-specific studies (e.g., , we did observe significant between-person effects such that women who reported more willingness to use both types of PBS, on average, also endorsed greater use. The between-person effect of intentions was significant for sexual assault PBS only, indicating women who reported higher average intentions were more likely to use PBS such as walking home with a friend. The impact of these between-person effects on event-level decision making varied based on the PBS type. For sexual assault PBS, a significant between-person by within-day change interaction was observed. Women who had below-average and average levels of willingness to use sexual assault PBS reported the highest actual use on days when their willingness to use sexual assault PBS increased; this pattern was not observed for women with above-average levels of overall willingness. Examination of Figure  suggests we may be observing a ceiling effect among above-average sexual assault PBS users. These women are regularly using sexual assault PBS at high rates with little room to increase. Findings suggest women who typically are less willing to use sexual assault PBS may benefit from eventlevel types of intervention to increase their willingness prior to higher risk occasions involving alcohol or potential sexual encounters , and that existing prevention efforts could focus on positively reinforcing the PBS use that is already happening. When examining cross-level interactions for drinking PBS, a different pattern of findings emerged. We observed a significant between-person by daily average interaction for willingness to use drinking PBS; women who tended to have the lowest overall willingness to use drinking PBS actually decreased their drinking PBS use on days when they reported more willingness to use them. There are several possible explanations for this finding that should be explored in future work. Perhaps these women are less successful with implementing these behaviors because they may be less familiar with using them or simply do not like to use them. It is also plausible that despite being more willing to use drinking PBS in advance of a drinking event, they may find themselves in an environment where they perceive none of their peers are using them, or that none of their peers would approve of their use. These women may be particularly affected by both drinking and PBS-specific normative influences . Either way, the findings are somewhat concerning because they highlight a lack of planning to use drinking PBS, and a lack of follow-through even when willingness is high. Interventions may need to strengthen the use of drinking PBS on a global level before event-level interventions are considered, and additional research may be needed to better understand normative influences and barriers associated with drinking PBS use. Notably, intraclass correlations revealed less event-level variability in PBS use than we expected to observe (15% for sexual assault PBS; 22% for drinking PBS), which may highlight several ways in which our study design could be strengthened in subsequent research. First, to minimize participant burden we chose to focus on college students' most commonly used PBS, yet decision-making processes may be different for less common PBS, especially if those are PBS women only use out of necessity (e.g., if a situation escalates and requires forceful physical resistance; . Expanding the number and types of PBS measured may capture the full range of strategies women choose to implement. More nuanced understanding of how women combine PBS and which PBS women use in different contexts would also better inform EMA measurement, and ultimately prevention . Second, post-hoc comparison of EMA participants to a reactivity control group suggested women may have increased PBS use in response to frequent assessment. While this is encouraging when considering the utility of momentary/event-level interventions to increase PBS use, it could have also resulted in reduced variability, or even over-reporting, of PBS use in daily assessments. Finally, we aimed to understand decisions leading up to drinking events, necessarily limiting analysis to drinking days. However, not all sexual assaults involve alcohol, and a woman's decision not to drink on a given day or in a specific context may be an intentional PBS. We may capture more event-level variability by examining a broader range of PBS and decisions to use PBS on both drinking and non-drinking days. Implications for Prevention Previous research has called for the integration and increased use of both sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS to enhance existing sexual assault prevention efforts . By examining women's decisions to use (or not use) PBS on drinking days, the current study serves as an initial step in providing an evidence-based way to help women utilize a ""toolkit"" of strategies that will help them to feel empowered and in control of their environment, while also reducing the likelihood they will be perceived by perpetrators as potential victims. Overwhelmingly, the current study highlights the need to increase intentions to use drinking PBS. Practitioners may consider using existing alcohol risk reduction strategies (e.g., motivational interviewing [MI; ; personalized normative feedback [PNF; ; parent-based intervention [PBI; ) and sexual assault risk reduction programs targeting heavy drinkers (e.g.,  to encourage women to think through common social scenarios and plan for which PBS they would use to minimize potential risk. Conversations that address barriers to using drinking PBS, like competing intentions to drink, might be enhanced by providing alternative strategies that can be used even if intentions to drink are high (e.g., alternating alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages vs. limiting to three or fewer drinks).  have successfully used similar approaches to increase women's use of forceful verbal and physical sexual assault resistance strategies in their Enhanced Assess, Acknowledge, Act (EAAA) program. Findings also revealed that intentions and willingness to use PBS operate at both between-person and within-person levels and may require different strategies to achieve behavior change. To address between-person differences, individuals who are more willing to use PBS may benefit from highlighting successful outcomes from prior PBS use to reinforce positive decisions. Those who are less willing to use PBS may require more intensive efforts to increase their willingness to use PBS, perhaps by first increasing their confidence in their ability to effectively use PBS . A similar approach to target within-person differences might be to reinforce intentions/willingness throughout the day, during an actual drinking event, or even prior to a potential sexual encounter, via text messages or interactive mobile apps. Because women are generally willing to use sexual assault PBS  and may increase use in response to frequent mobile assessment, interventions that reach them in the moments when they need to be used (or immediately before) may increase use during higherrisk occasions. Prevention scientists might consider supplementing efficacious individual-level interventions (e.g., MI, PNF, PBI, EAAA) with adaptive mobile components that aim to increase or maintain high levels of event-level PBS use. Event-level evaluation of PBS use following program exposure would provide valuable insight into how to structure supplemental intervention messaging, while capturing program impacts on PBS use that are not captured using more traditional longitudinal evaluation methods. Finally, practitioners and scientists alike might consider the utility of both sexual assault and drinking PBS in their prevention programs and research. Previous research shows women use more sexual assault PBS on days when they drink . This suggests sexual assault PBS may be particularly appealing and more likely to be used among drinkers. These strategies may enhance alcohol reduction programs' impact on sexual assault outcomes (e.g., . Further, sexual assault risk reduction programs are often sought out by women with prior victimization experience , who may be at increased risk for heavy drinking . Whereas most programs address alcohol as a situational risk factor, more robust discussion of drinking PBS may be useful for these women. Regardless of the setting, discussions of PBS use should be coupled with reminders that these strategies aim to reduce risk, but may not completely eliminate it. It is equally important to highlight that if women experience sexual assault even after using PBS, that does not imply the assault was their fault; sexual assault is always caused by a perpetrator. In a continued effort to shift the responsibility of sexual assault prevention away from potential victims, practitioners should implement both alcohol and sexual assault risk reduction programs in combination with efficacious programs that reduce community-level risk (e.g., bystander intervention;  and perpetration behaviors . Limitations and Future Directions Although careful controls were in place throughout the study, certain limitations remain. Our sample size was sufficient to address the proposed research questions, but findings would be strengthened from replication in a larger, more diverse sample of women who engage in different patterns of drinking (abstainers, light, moderate, and heavy). Including light and non-drinkers in future research would be beneficial considering they may still be at risk when they are in the presence of others who are drinking. Decision-making patterns also should be examined among different groups of students we know to be at increased risk for alcohol-related problems and/or sexual victimization (e.g., LGBTQ, international, racial/ethnic minority and first-generation students; those involved in Greek Life or with a history or prior victimization), as they may have unique prevention needs. Although a significant portion of our sample indicated intentions to join Greek Life, our data do not indicate who actually joined, and we were underpowered for the three-way interactions required to reliably examine group differences. Although EMA compliance was high (>90%), initial response and enrollment rates could be improved, perhaps by offering online/virtual training or higher incentives. To minimize respondent burden, the current study examined a limited set of theoretical constructs (i.e., intentions and willingness). Additional work is needed to examine contextual and intrapersonal decision-making factors (e.g., norms, attitudes, expectancies, perceived situational risk) at the event level to better understand malleable constructs that can be targeted by interventions. Further, we were unable to link PBS use to sexual assault outcomes because there was limited endorsement of unwanted sexual experiences on any of the 14 measured occasions. Although these associations are wellestablished using cross-sectional and non-diary longitudinal designs , linking PBS use and sexual assault outcomes at the event-level would uniquely inform prevention. Such a study would likely require a longer EMA data collection period (e.g., 30 days) and an event-contingent assessment method to capture outcomes tied to specific PBS use. Finally, our data were exclusively self-reported. The intrusive nature of repeated self-report data collection has been identified as a potential source of bias (e.g., reactivity to study procedures) and a threat to ecological validity . This work could be enhanced by incorporating unobtrusive data collection techniques, such as video diaries, biosensors, or geolocation data, which have the potential to eliminate self-report biases, provide robust monitoring of alcohol consumption, and add to our contextual understanding of PBS use (e.g., how decisions to use PBS are made at different levels of intoxication; whether decisions vary across social contexts or physical locations). Conclusion The current study was the first to examine event-level decisions to use both sexual assault and drinking PBS. The findings demonstrated decision-making constructs related to using sexual assault and drinking PBS among college women vary between people and at the event level, and unique intervention approaches may be needed to increase specific types of PBS. Findings from the study also highlight the need for both global and eventlevel intervention approaches to be tailored to women based on their current willingness and intentions to utilize PBS rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.

4,4,Attachment and Borderline Personality Disorder: Differential Effects on Situational Socio-Affective Processes,"Insecure attachment and borderline personality disorder (BPD) are defined by similar affective and interpersonal processes. Individuals diagnosed with BPD, however, represent only a subset of those described as insecurely attached, suggesting that attachment may hold broader relevance for socio-affective functioning. Based on a 21-day ecological momentary assessment protocol in a mixed clinical and community sample (N = 207) oversampled for BPD, we evaluate the discriminant validity of each construct as it influences daily interpersonal interactions. We find that insecure attachment is associated with elevated perceptions of interpersonal disaffiliation and maladaptive strategies for affect regulation, whereas enacted interpersonal hostility is more distinctive for BPD. In a series of sensitivity analyses, we further highlight potential caveats to these findings when studying both constructs concurrently. Together, our results suggest that both insecure attachment and BPD contribute to problematic affective and interpersonal processes, but that they do so at different stages of the unfolding social interaction, which has important implications for their maintenance and treatment.","[""Attachment"", ""Borderline personality disorder"", ""Ambulatory assessment"", ""Multilevel structural equation modeling"", ""Daily socio-affective processes""]",10.1007/s42761-020-00017-7,"progression . However, only a subgroup of those described as insecurely attached develops symptoms of BPD , implicating partially, but not fully, overlapping interpersonal and affective liabilities . To address this issue of conceptual redundancy, we evaluated the shared and distinctive contributions of insecure attachment and BPD features to socio-affective processes that characterize interpersonal interactions in daily life in a mixed clinical and community sample of adults. Attachment theory  provides a conceptual framework to explain how experiences in close relationships contribute to generalized patterns of affect and cognition . Individual differences in attachment are organized along two dimensions-anxiety and avoidance. Theoretically, each attachment orientation is related to a distinct pattern of maladaptive interpersonal and affect-regulatory strategies, both of which increase the likelihood of negative affective experiences . Together, these patterns may be understood as protective efforts to navigate relationships characterized by rejection and inconsistency , a notion that resonates with theories suggesting that core etiological mechanisms of BPD are shaped by an invalidating developmental environment . Research supports the relationship between the two, with ~ 90% of patients diagnosed with BPD being described as insecurely attached . However, because the defining features of BPD overlap conceptually and empirically with outcomes described by attachment theory , this observation appears to be tautological. Yet, insecure attachment is also found in many individuals from nonclinical samples (e.g., . Estimates from community samples suggest that 55-65% of adults are securely attached, whereas 10-15% are avoidantly and 15-20% anxiously attached  with BPD constituting a small subset of those with insecure attachment (i.e., prevalence rates of ~ 1.5% in the general population; . Such epidemiological data support theoretical notions that insecure attachment is a vulnerability factor in the pathogenesis of BPD. However, efforts to arrive at conclusions about how attachment relates to BPD are complicated by methodological issues such as the diversity of attachment measures, the use of heterogeneous samples, and a reliance on crosssectional study designs . As a way to address these limitations, Contemporary Integrative Interpersonal Theory of personality and psychopathology  provides an ideal framework for studying the shared and distinct contributions of insecure attachment and BPD to impairments in socio-affective functioning. Key to interpersonal theory is the assumption that individual differences are reflected in characteristic patterns of affective and behavioral processes arising during social interactions in response to perceived internal (i.e., mental construal) and external (i.e., proximal behavior of others) social cues . Previous work  has established two orthogonal dimensions that organize interpersonal perception and behavior and together form the interpersonal circumplex: agency (i.e., dominance vs. submissiveness) and communion (i.e., affiliation vs. quarrelsomeness). As an integrative model, interpersonal theory encompasses the mental representations central to attachment theory as well as the affective and interpersonal processes that define BPD. It also provides a neutral set of concepts to evaluate how distinct constructs affect the direction and strength of momentary interpersonal and affective processes, allowing investigators to avoid the conceptual circularity and confounding effects inherent in previous studies. In the past, this framework has been applied to study interpersonal patterns in BPD and-to a lesser extent-insecure attachment orientations. For example,  found that perceptions of others' quarrelsome behavior (i.e., dissaffilative behavior) predicted one's own quarrelsomeness and that this association was facilitated by negative affect. Importantly, relative to controls, individuals with a BPD diagnosis were more likely to respond to perceptions of quarrelsomeness with negative affect (although the ensuing link between negative affect and quarrelsome behavior was not specific to BPD). Others have investigated similar processes in BPD, generally demonstrating that individuals with a BPD diagnosis were more likely to perceive others as less benevolent on average, but also to respond to those perceptions with increased negative affect . Studies of insecure attachment and interpersonal processes in everyday life parallel those results.  examined the relationship between attachment and withinperson changes in affect in response to perceptions of an interaction partner's agreeable behavior. Anxious and avoidant attachment orientations both enhanced the link between perceptions of another's less agreeable behavior and negative affect, albeit to different degrees. These specific results are consistent with previous findings suggesting that insecurely attached individuals describe their social interactions to be less satisfying and respond to perceptions of interpersonal coldness with heightened negative affect . Both sets of studies accord with theoretical models of BPD that emphasize sensitivity to rejection or coldness from others . However, they also align with notions of heightened sensitivity to threat cues as described in insecure attachments in nonclinical samples . The goal of the present study was to identify more clearly the shared and specific contributions of each construct to the behavioral and affective processes that may derail social interactions in daily life. To accomplish this aim, we examined the interpersonal and affective patterns relevant to two critical pathways: The momentary elevation of negative affect in response to perceptions of one's interaction partner (interpersonal sensitivity) and the unfolding interpersonal behavioral response (behavioral reactivity). Method All procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh institutional review board (Protocol 12030125). Participants Couples were recruited via flyers posted in psychiatric treatment clinics. Current outpatients were screened by phone for both BPD and any other personality disorder (PD) using the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD  and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems PD Scales . Patients were excluded from enrolling in the study if they met criteria for a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar disorder or psychosis. Although the parent study included a total of 260 participants (i.e., 130 couples), not all participants provided the necessary data for inclusion in our study. Participants were excluded if they did not provide any Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) reports (n = 8), did not provide EMA reports about interpersonal interactions (n = 42), or did not finish reports on interpersonal situations (n = 3). Excluded participants did not differ from included participants on key variables of the study (e.g., age, gender, BPD severity; mean p value > .09). Thus, the final sample size for this study was 207 participants. These participants included slightly more females (54%) than males and were predominantly white (74%). The mean age was 30.5 (SD = 6.8), and n = 43 (21%) met the diagnostic threshold for BPD, with the majority of participants (n = 146, 71%) having at least one criterion. Due to missing data, sample sizes across models vary slightly. Procedure Following the baseline assessment where participants completed clinical interviews and selfreport measures, they received a smartphone equipped with an application devised for this study and instructions for its use. Every day for 3 weeks, records of their setting, situation, mood, and interpersonal behavior were completed following every interpersonal interaction that lasted at least 10 min. As participants submitted responses, data were transferred to a secure database accessible to study staff via a virtual Web server. Enabling access to data in real time allowed study staff to monitor compliance daily. If a participant did not complete at least one interpersonal interaction record per day, study staff called the participant and assessed whether any interpersonal interactions had occurred that day and, if necessary, discussed and solved any technical or motivational issues. Participants were compensated $40 for completion of the interview, and up to $165 for completion of the ambulatory assessment. Rates of compliance were generally good: The average percent of days in which participants completed at least one entry was 84%, with an average of M = 67 interactions per participant. Measures Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised-The Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R)  is a self-report measure of adult attachment that has been used and validated in BPD samples . It consists of 36 items, which measure romantic attachment along two dimensions: avoidance (18 items; for example, I prefer not to show a partner how I feel deep down) and anxiety (18 items; for example, I worry about being abandoned). Participants responded to each item using a 7-point scale from 1 (""strongly disagree"") to 7 (""strongly agree""), rating the extent to which each item is descriptive of how they usually feel and behave in romantic relationships. Ratings were then averaged to compute scores for each dimension. High scores reflected more anxious and avoidant attachment orientations. Internal consistencies of both scales were excellent in our sample, with α = .91 (95% CIs: 0.90; 0.91) for avoidance and α = .93 (95% CIs: 0.93; 0.93) for anxiety. Personality Disorder Features-Participants were interviewed using the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality (SIDP-IV; . Interviewers rated each PD criterion on a scale ranging from 0 to 3. We operationalized BPD features as the dimensional sum of the BPD criteria scores; in a supplementary analysis (Table ), we used the total of the remaining PD criteria as a covariate. To determine interrater agreement, video recordings of the SIDP-IV interviews from a sample of five participants were reviewed and scored independently by seven research team members (intraclass correlations: PD = .97; BPD = .90). Momentary Interpersonal Behavior of Self and Other-The participant's interpersonal behaviors and the participant's perceptions of the other's behavior during the interaction were assessed using the Social Behavior Inventory (SBI; . The SBI is a checklist of 46 behavioral items (rated yes or no) designed to fit the structural model of the interpersonal circumplex used by Contemporary Integrative Interpersonal Theory . In line with , participants responded to a checklist with a subset of 12 items to describe their own behavior during each interaction. These 12 behavioral items measured each of the four poles of the interpersonal circumplex (i.e., dominant vs. submissive; agreeable vs. quarrelsome). From these, we created two subscales corresponding to dominance (Dominance = Dominant -Submissive) and affiliation (Affiliation = Agreeable -Quarrelsome). Prior work has treated the four scales as separate, but we collapsed them based on theoretical grounds, and to reduce number of statistical models/tests, as we have done in our prior work . Participants rated their perceptions of the interaction partner's behaviors on a subset of 7 items that did not vary and that were scored similarly for dominance and affiliation. The proportion of between-person variance, calculated using the intraclass correlation, for the dominance dimension was .12 for perceived and .07 for enacted dominance, and for the affiliation dimension was .16 for perceived and .17 for enacted affiliation. Momentary Affect-Each electronic diary record presented 19 negative affect adjectives on a 5-point scale (1 = very slightly or not at all, 5 = extremely) from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Extended version (PANAS-X; . Analytic Plan We used multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) to test shared and specific contributions of insecure attachment and BPD on socio-affective processes in daily social interactions. MSEM can accommodate momentary events nested within persons and allows for the estimation of random effects (i.e., intercepts and slopes that vary across individuals). MSEM allows for the decomposition of the total variance of each within-person assessed variable into the latent between-person level variance and the within-person level residual variance (Fig. ). This decomposition is done in a standard multilevel model when estimating a random intercept for an outcome/dependent variable, but like with single-level SEM, all variables can be either predictors or outcomes. Thus, in MSEM this latent decomposition is possible for all momentary variables in the model. The advantage is that this flexibility adjusts for differences in reliability of measurement across individuals who provide discrepant numbers of observations. In the current study, the between-person variance reflects individual differences in the observed variables, and the within-person variance reflects situation-to-situation departures from each individual's mean on these variables. Thus, the MSEM used in this study estimates separately the between-person portion of the model, which represents average associations among individual differences in observed variables collapsed across all situations (akin to cross-sectional designs), and the within-person level portion of the model, which represents associations among variables that fluctuate from situation-to-situation. Because all the modeled associations are among concurrently assessed variables and not lagged, this means that the within-person associations reflect situation-to-situation dynamic processes, but they do not directly establish temporal precedence. All models were estimated in Mplus (version 8.3; . Bayesian estimation based on the Gibbs sampler ) was used because it provides a true latent decomposition into within-and between-person variance for both the predictor and outcome variables when random effects are specified. Significance for all model parameters was based on 95% Credibility Intervals (CIs), with CIs that excluded zero indicative of a parameter that differed significantly from zero. Figure  provides a diagram of the two key estimated models. As outlined above, literature suggests that sensitivity to interpersonal threat cues (interpersonal sensitivity) is amplified in BPD and insecure attachment (e.g., . Moreover, hostile behavioral reactivity in response to interpersonal perceptions is a key symptom of BPD, and similar-yet less severe-patterns are also observed in insecurely attached individuals . In model set 1, we examined interpersonal responsivity and behavioral reactivity at the within-person level in an unconditional model with no substantive between-person predictors of individual differences in the within-person paths, thereby serving as a baseline for interpreting subsequent effects. Interpersonal responsivity refers to the prediction of one's own situational behavior by momentary perceptions of other's behavior, and behavioral reactivity to the prediction of one's own momentary behavior by momentary negative affect. At the same time, model set 1 also regressed ratings of momentary negative affect on momentary perceptions of the other's behavior, a path we referred to as interpersonal sensitivity (see Fig.  for an overview of momentary within-person links). Importantly, negative affect was situated as an intervening variable to account for the associations between perceptions of others' and one's own behavior. Within-person regression paths were estimated as randomly varying across individuals. At the between-person level, the average of one's own behavior was regressed on average negative affect and perceptions of others', while negative affect was additionally regressed on perceptions of others'. In a subsequent step (model set 2), we introduced insecure attachment and BPD features as joint moderators of individual differences in all within-person paths, as well as predictors of individual differences in interpersonal perceptions, negative affect, and one's own behavior. To determine the robustness of our analyses, we examined the extent to which our results would be affected by theoretically plausible alterations of the operationalization of betweenperson level effects. These sensitivity analyses are summarized in Table  and detailed in the supplementary files. Full model specifications can be found at https://osf.io/k5pxc/. Model set 2a tested attachment and BPD as between-person predictors in two separate models. This modeling decision is based on the observation that insecure attachment and BPD empirically overlap, and it allowed us to assess each predictor's separate predictive validity. Model set 2b examined the differential contribution of the two attachment dimensions. Therefore, we entered anxious and avoidant attachment independently as between-person predictors in two separate models. Finally, to further isolate the specific effects of anxious or avoidant attachment and BPD, and parse out variance attributable to general interpersonal dysfunction, model set 2c included a covariate that was calculated as the sum of the remaining PD features to adjust for general interpersonal functioning (PD; model set 2c). Sex and age (centered on mean age) were also included as covariates in all models at the between-person level, and observation number (i.e., time centered on mean of observations) was included as a within-person covariate (see  for a similar approach). Coefficients for covariates will not be presented for parsimony. Along with other parameters not reported in the tables (e.g., residual variances), covariances among between-person variables are not depicted in the diagrams, but full specifications and detailed output from all models can be found online at https://osf.io/de246/. Table  summarizes pooled withinperson correlations among the variables along with correlations among the random intercepts at the between-person level. Results Model Set 1: Momentary Socio-Affective Processes We first tested whether perceptions of others' behavior and one's own behavior were associated (i.e., within-person interpersonal responsivity path), and whether negative affect could account for this link. The results of this model are presented on the left side of Table . We found that perceptions of others' lower affiliation significantly predicted higher negative affect (i.e., interpersonal sensitivity within-person path), and higher negative affect significantly predicted lower affiliative behavior (i.e., behavioral reactivity within-person path). The indirect effect was significant, yet the direct association (i.e., interpersonal responsivity within-person path) remained significant as well, suggesting negative affect only partially accounted for the within-person link between perceptions of affiliation and one's own affiliative behavior. When predicting one's own dominant behavior from perceptions of affiliation, we found a significant but modest direct effect, but negative affect did not significantly account for this association. Specifically, though perceptions of less affiliation by others predicted more negative affect (interpersonal sensitivity within-person path) as was the case in the prior model given it is the same path, negative affect did not predict dominant behavior (behavioral reactivity path; right side of Table ). Across both model specifications, significant between-person main effects of perceptions of others' behavior (Perc i ), one's own behavior (Beh i ), and negative affect (NA i ) indicate that those variables varied significantly across participants, suggesting that individual differences (i.e., PD, BPD, insecure attachment) may account for these variation patterns (see model set 2). Model Set 2: Moderation of Momentary Socio-Affective Processes by Insecure Attachment and BPD Next, we tested whether insecure attachment features moderated the three within-person paths described above. Individual differences in the strength of the interpersonal sensitivity, behavioral reactivity, and interpersonal responsivity paths were regressed on insecure attachment features as well as BPD, as were the intercepts of interpersonal perceptions, one's own behavior, and negative affect. Neither insecure attachment nor BPD features had an effect on the interpersonal sensitivity path when both were included in the model. However, both insecure attachment and BPD features moderated the behavioral reactivity within-person path (link between negative affect and affiliative behavior; left side of Table ). Specifically, while insecure attachment dampened the negative association (i.e., made it weaker) between negative affect and affiliative behavior, BPD features amplified this same relationship. In addition, we found that insecure attachment was associated with higher negative affect and perceptions of lower affiliation in others at the between-person level, whereas BPD features were associated with lower affiliative behavior. In addition to those findings, for dominant behavior (right side of Table ), BPD features dampened the positive link between perceptions of other affiliation and dominant behavior (interpersonal responsivity) and amplified dominant behavioral reactivity to negative affect. Sensitivity Analyses To check the robustness and clarify the interpretation of the observed effects, we examined the extent to which results from model 2 were affected by a series of changes in model specification at the between-person level. Model Set 2a To clarify further the nature of effects observed in model 2, we re-ran the model twice, (a) once without the inclusion of BPD symptoms as a predictor and (b) once without the inclusion of insecure attachment (i.e., we ran two separate models). These analyses yielded a significant negative moderation of interpersonal sensitivity by insecure attachment, along with a positive between-person effect on negative affect and a negative between-person effect on perceptions of others' affiliation. Similar, but weaker, effects emerged for BPD for individual differences in negative affect and perception. In addition to these findings, a negative between-person effect on own affiliative behavior emerged, whereas BPD did not moderate any of the three within-person paths outlined in Fig.  (see Table ). For dominant behavior, our analyses yielded a negative moderating effect of insecure attachment on interpersonal sensitivity as with the prior models above, whereas BPD only negatively moderated the path of interpersonal responsivity. Model Set 2b We next examined Model 2 by decomposing insecure attachment into its constituent dimensions of anxiety and avoidance and entering both separately into two independent models. The pattern of results remained largely the same for each dimension of attachment. Anxious and avoidant attachment were positively associated with individual differences in the negative affect, and BPD features evidenced a significant negative between-persons association with affiliative behavior. Both anxious and avoidant attachment orientations positively moderated the link between negative affect and own affiliative behavioral reactivity. BPD, in contrast, had no moderating effect on any of the paths in our model (Table ). For dominant behavior (Table ), we found that BPD amplified the link between negative affect and one's own dominance (i.e., behavioral reactivity) as well as the link between perceived affiliation and dominance (i.e., interpersonal responsivity), but only when entered jointly with avoidant attachment. Model Set 2c After adding all other PD features to our set of predictors, anxious attachment moderated the interpersonal sensitivity path, whereas BPD moderated affiliative behavioral reactivity. When BPD was entered jointly with avoidant attachment, both moderated the behavioral reactivity path, yet in different directions (i.e., avoidant: positively; BPD: negatively). When predicting dominant behavior from perceived affiliation, anxious attachment continued to enhance affiliative interpersonal sensitivity, whereas BPD dampened the interpersonal responsivity link between perceptions of other affiliation and own dominant behavior. When entered together with avoidant attachment orientations, only BPD negatively moderated the interpersonal responsivity link. PD, in contrast, had no additional moderating influence on any of the paths. Also, because it can be argued that the effects of attachment should be most pronounced within the context of situations that activate the attachment system, such as those involving close relationship partners (e.g., , we controlled for interactions occurring between both partners. Moreover, controlling for interactions within couples had no impact on the pattern of results. Note that including the effects of attachment orientation and BPD simultaneously in models reveals their potentially unique effects, but not the effect of their common variance. Thus, to examine the impact of what these constructs share on socio-affective functioning in daily life, we modeled in an exploratory analysis a latent, between-person factor comprising the pooled variance of insecure attachment orientations and BPD features. This analysis revealed a positive between-person effect on negative affect and a significant negative effect on perceptions of the other's affiliative and own affiliative behavior. Neither effects for own dominant behavior nor cross-level interaction effects emerged. Discussion BPD and insecure attachment orientations are characterized by similar socio-affective processes: Patients diagnosed with BPD, but also individuals described as insecurely attached, are inclined to perceive interpersonal situations negatively and exhibit stronger negative affect in response, potentially resulting in maladaptive interpersonal behavioral responses. Using Contemporary Integrative Interpersonal Theory's notion of the interpersonal situation as context , we evaluated the discriminant validity of BPD and attachment for socio-affective processes (interpersonal sensitivity and responsivity, behavioral reactivity) in daily social interactions. Across a series of sensitivity analyses (Table ), BPD features were reliably related to less affiliative interpersonal behavior, whereas insecure attachment was more consistently related to amplified experiences of negative affect in interpersonal situations and less affiliative perceptions of others. Regarding cross-level interactions, the pattern of results was more ambiguous because it varied as a function of modeling decisions. The distinctive outcomes most relevant to BPD features emerged in the context of dominant behavior, where the behavioral reactivity and interpersonal responsivity paths were moderated by BPD. Specifically, the generally negative association between perceived affiliation and dominant behavior was less pronounced in people diagnosed with BPD, whereas the positive link between negative affect and dominant behavior was amplified in the same group. In line with the main effects reported above, the distinctive outcomes most relevant to insecure (particularly anxious) attachment emerged in the interpersonal sensitivity path. However, across sensitivity analyses, this cross-level interaction effect only emerged when insecure attachment was entered as the only predictor, or in combination with general PD features. Overall, our finding that perceptions of others' disaffiliation and negative affect were more strongly pronounced in insecurely attached individuals mirrors previous work by . It is also consistent with theoretical work emphasizing the role of invalidating relationship experiences for the development of heightened emotional sensitivity in BPD . Complementing previous findings by , however, we further demonstrated that when controlling for BPD features, the moderating effect of insecure attachment on the within-person interpersonal sensitivity link disappeared. Across sensitivity analyses, this effect only appeared when insecure attachment was entered without BPD (model 2a), or when controlling for general PD (model 2c). The path most difficult to interpret for both constructs was the within-person disaffiliative behavioral reactivity path (left side of Table ), which was moderated by both insecure attachment and BPD, albeit to different degrees and in different directions. Whereas BPD dampened the association between perceived affiliation and own affiliative behavior, insecure attachment enhanced this link. Because this effect was variable across sensitivity analyses (left side of Table ), it needs to be interpreted with caution. Importantly, the effect did not emerge when we entered insecure attachment or BPD as single predictors. Therefore, it is possible, that when controlling for the overlapping features in each construct, the remaining variance may have caused a spurious suppression effect. However, using a latent variable to isolate BPDs and IAs shared variance only had significant effects on individual differences, not the cross-level interactions. Overall, these supplementary analyses offer further evidence that both insecure attachment and BPD contribute to challenging affective and interpersonal processes, but that they do so at different stages of the unfolding social interaction. Our findings also diverge somewhat from previous work. In contrast to , who reported an effect of BPD features on the relationship between perceived quarrelsome behavior and negative affect, the pattern in our analyses consistently suggests no role of BPD features in moderating that momentary association. Our results may diverge due to methodological differences. For example, we applied a dimensional approach to operationalizing BPD, and Sadikaj et al. ( ) used an extreme-groups design (BPD patients vs. healthy controls). Sampling extremes of the BPD severity distribution leads to the exclusion of its central portions, and the results in enhanced power for statistical tests (e.g., . We acknowledge that sampling may also have had an effect on our results. Our data were drawn from a study designed primarily to study BPD, 43 of the participants met diagnostic threshold for BPD, and others had sub-threshold BPD. Thus, patients in this sample were more prone to dysregulation and insecure forms of attachment than healthy community samples. At the same time, this higher base rate likely increased the power of our analyses to detect meaningful discriminant validity between the constructs. While we view this as a strength, this same study design should be repeated in nonclinical samples. Moreover, for all personality disorders, relationship experiences and enhanced affective reactivity play a significant role in their etiology and maintenance (e.g., . Thus, future studies with distinct (clinical) sample compositions should test the transdiagnostic validity of our results for other psychopathologies. Finally, it is important to note that SIDP-IV questions specifically encourage respondents to talk about usual behaviors and long-term aspects of social functioning by prompting them to ""remember what you are like when you are your usual self."" This emphasis on behavior, in comparison with the emphasis on worries and feelings throughout the ECR-R items, may have amplified the conceptual distinction between the two constructs assessed in this study. Beyond novel insights into key distinctive socio-affective features of attachment and BPD, our research underscores the crucial role that attachment has on the exacerbation and maintenance of BPD. Given the differences in prevalence rates, with BPD accounting for just a fraction of those described as insecurely attached, future research might focus on general processes of modifying relational templates as a potential mechanism for preventing the development of full-blown BPD under circumstances of elevated insecure attachment. In the past, experiences in close relationships have been recognized as putative mechanisms of change . In our study, insecure attachment orientations predicted greater interpersonal negativity and affective dysregulation as well as their association in daily social interactions when  Descriptive statistics and correlations at the between-person and within-person level Model set 1: key coefficients from multilevel models accounted for by negative affect (na)  "
5,5,Capturing emotion coherence in daily life: Using ambulatory physiology measures and ecological momentary assessments to examine within-person associations and individual differences,"While emotion coherence has long been theorized to be a core feature of emotion, to date, studies examining response coherence have been conducted in laboratory settings. The present study used a combined approach of ambulatory physiology measures and ecological momentary assessment conducted over a 4-week period to examine the extent to which emotional experience and physiology show coherence in daily life within-persons; and whether individual differences in response coherence are associated with between-person differences in well-being, negative emotionality, and gender. Results revealed that, on average, individuals exhibited coherence between subjective experience and physiology of emotion, but that there was substantial between-person variation in coherence in daily life. Exploratory analyses revealed no credible link between levels of response coherence and well-being, negative emotionality, or gender. Findings contribute to the literature by demonstrating a novel methodological approach to measuring coherence in daily life and supporting the generalizability of coherence to ecologically valid contexts.","[""Emotion coherence"", ""Emotion concordance"", ""Response coherence"", ""EMA"", ""Well-being""]",10.1016/j.biopsycho.2021.108074,"Introduction Functionalist models of emotion suggest that coherence across physiological, experiential, and behavior response systems supports effective responding to environmental challenges which may, over time, be associated with greater well-being . Although there is disagreement in the literature with respect to average levels of emotion coherence , researchers generally agree that individuals differ in the extent to which they exhibit emotion coherence (also called concordance; . A growing body of work suggests that individual differences in emotion coherence are associated with multiple indicators of adaptive function. Studies have reported associations between greater emotion coherence and subjective well-being , physical health , emotion regulation , and body awareness . However, little is known about the specific processes that contribute to coherence, and very little research has examined the implications of coherence outside of the laboratory setting. The current study utilizes an intensive sampling design incorporating ambulatory measures of autonomic physiology and participant self-reports over a 28-day period to examine whether coherence in emotional arousal is observed in the daily context (i.e., in the absence of experimentally induced affective states), and whether coherence in this context is associated with individual differences in psychological well-being. Researchers have long recognized that emotion is experienced across multiple levels of analysis including physiological (e.g., heart rate), cognitive (e.g., subjective experience), and behavioral manifestations (e. g., facial expression). The most commonly used physiological measures in emotion research are electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate (HR), both of which show rapid dynamic reactivity (on the order of seconds) to emotional stimuli and are proposed to facilitate behavioral actions congruent with the emotion . EDA reflects sympathetic nervous system activity, while HR contains both sympathetic and parasympathetic influence . Manifestations of emotion across these levels of analysis are subjectively experienced as concurrent processes, but researchers have long sought to understand their sequential relation to one another. Early theoretical models proposed that subjective emotional state was induced by a physiological response to a stimulus, thus asserting that coherence between these levels of analysis was a defining quality of emotion . Though some studies of emotion coherence examine coherence between physiology and behavior (e.g., , many studies of emotion coherence frequently examine the extent of association between physiological reactivity and self-reported subjective emotional state in the context of an experimental emotion induction. One study found that emotion induction using both film and music stimuli produced relatively coherent associations between physiology and self-report across 5 basic emotions , although some studies report differences in coherence across emotion categories, with stronger coherence in high-arousal emotion conditions such as fear . Subsequent theoretical models, however, demonstrate that subjective emotional experience is a complex product of physiological signals and cognitive processing of historical and contextual cues that enables one to apply an affective label to their experiential state . In contrast to earlier models, the Schachter-Singer framework proposes that discrete emotions are not bound by unique physiological signatures, but that patterns of physiological arousal could be associated with a range of emotional states that could vary significantly in valence while being similar in arousal (e.g., excitement/anger). Consistent with this framework, research supports associations between physiological arousal and emotional experience, but has failed to identify emotion-specific physiological signatures . Changes in EDA have been shown to reflect general changes in arousal that are not necessarily reflective of emotional valence . In other words, increases in EDA may reflect a change in affective state from a low-arousal emotion (e.g., contentment) to a high-arousal emotion (e.g., excitement) but does not reliably differentiate among high-arousal emotions (e.g. excitement/anger/fear). Similarly, several studies have identified coherence between HR and self-reported arousal . In addition, core affect theories suggest that individual differences in arousal focus-the degree to which one attends to the arousal dimension of affective experience-is linked to greater interoceptive accuracy . These findings are consistent with the supposition that arousal contributes to, but does not dictate the nature of the emotional state, suggesting that coherence between physiology and self-reported specific emotion is not necessarily likely, while coherence between physiology and self-reported arousal may be more in line with prior findings. Component process models of emotion also suggest that response synchronization is an adaptational function of emotion . For example, subjective awareness of arousal may aid in monitoring internal states, underscoring the role of awareness of arousal as part of the multicomponent emotion response. The present study adds to this literature by examining coherence in emotional arousal based on physiology and self-report measures. More recently, research has documented the extent of individual differences in emotion coherence across channels, suggesting that coherence itself may be a meaningful marker of emotional function beyond the extent of emotional reactivity in individual response domains . Indeed, a recent study found that individuals with a higher degree of within-person coherence across physiological and subjective response to a stress condition were characterized by better emotional and physical health . However, the mechanisms through which greater coherence relates to greater well-being have generally not been well-elaborated in the literature, either theoretically, or empirically. Given that most prominent theories of emotion suggest a significant contribution of peripheral physiological activation in the experience and construction of subjective emotion , it is possible that individual differences in emotion coherence arise from individual differences in body attunement. Physiological research indicates that individuals differ in the extent to which they are interoceptively aware . Because awareness of physiological reactivity is an important precursor to emotional labeling  and subjective emotional state , the extent to which individuals are aware of changes in their physiological arousal may be a necessary component of emotional coherence. Indeed, a recent study of individuals high in body awareness found evidence of coherence between heart rate and emotional intensity, where emotional intensity was a measure of the extent of deviation from neutral regardless of the directional valence . Building on this line of work, we propose that the extent of coherence between physiological arousal and subjective arousal awareness is an important component of emotion coherence and examine it in the daily context. Measurement context Examination of emotion coherence further requires consideration of the alignment between the theoretical construct and its measurement. Some researchers have argued that the analytical approaches used in many studies are not appropriate to test the core tenants of emotion coherence (cf. . Specifically, traditional analysis techniques rely on between-person comparisons that assess whether individuals with relatively higher levels of physiological arousal report relatively stronger emotions. This approach does not truly examine emotion dynamics, and whether moments when an individual experiences an increase in physiological arousal are associated with concurrent changes in emotional experience. Studies that have employed a within-person analysis framework have more consistently identified evidence of coherence . However, the extent to which these findings reflect coherence as a generalized trait are limited by the restricted contexts in which coherence is assessed. Specifically, despite the centrality of functionalist theoretical accounts of emotion coherence in the literature , focal hypotheses arising from these theories (e.g. that coherence is adaptive) have been examined exclusively in laboratory settings in the context of experimental manipulations of emotion condition. This context may only provide limited insight into the implications of coherence in daily life. For instance, laboratory conditions establish strong and consistent context cues about the nature of the emotion being induced, whereas typical daily life often requires people to navigate emotional experiences in more ambiguous contexts. In order to advance our understanding of emotion coherence, research needs to examine individuals in naturalistic settings. The advent of new technologies makes possible the measurement of autonomic physiological activity over long intervals and without restrictions on movement or location through the use of wearable devices . Coupled with the ability to deploy psychological surveys directly to the participants' smartphones, researchers are well positioned to examine emotion coherence in everyday life through ecological momentary assessment (EMA; Shiffman, Stone, & Hufford, 2008). EMA studies are generally geared towards learning about life as it is lived by collecting repeated measures on momentary experiences, from many participants. The intensive longitudinal data yielded in EMA studies enables researchers to examine processes at the within-person level by observing the associations between an individual's self-reported emotion and concurrent physiological activity repeatedly over time . Accordingly, utilizing intensive longitudinal data that consists of both subjective self-reported experiences and in-vivo physiological recording provides an opportunity for the measurement of coherence in daily life that may be more representative of normative emotional responding. The present study To advance the knowledge base of coherence in daily life, the present study used EMA data to assess coherence of physiological activity and subject arousal awareness in a sample of adults measured over a 28-day period. A wrist-worn device measured HR and EDA continuously throughout the day, and participants were prompted 6 times per day to complete self-report questionnaires on their own smartphones. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects modeling, cast in Bayesian statistical framework , to (1) determine whether emotion coherence in daily life, in terms of emotional arousal, was evident at the within-person level similar to what has been observed in laboratory/experimental studies, and (2) which physiological channels show coherence with subjective awareness of arousal. HR is a consciously accessible physiological marker that has been consistently examined in research on body awareness and interoception . EDA is also considered a robust marker of affective arousal . Finally, we (3) examined potential between-person moderators of emotion coherence. Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that coherence will be higher among women , and that individuals with higher coherence have higher subjective well-being and lower trait negative emotionality (e.g., . Methods We analyzed data from a larger EMA study that explored people's everyday life experiences, with special focus on psychological wellbeing and the dynamics of emotion. All scripts for data analyses are available via OSF at the following link: https://osf.io/scgev/? view_only=f2aba20f81064ccf87942321d60a0c5d. All procedures were approved by the IRB (protocol #00001017). Participants The sample consisted of twenty-five participants (17 women, 8 men) ranging from 21 to 66 years of age (M = 32.2, SD = 10.40). Participants were recruited from the community adjacent to a large, Northeastern university. The majority of the participants were White (84 %, n = 21) with the remaining participants identifying as Asian (8 %, n = 2) and Latino/a (8 %, n = 2). Procedure After consenting to participate in the study, participants completed a battery of baseline questionnaires consisting of demographic and psychological items. They also provided their phone numbers to the research assistants and were enrolled in SurveySignal text messaging service  for delivery of the daily self-report survey prompts (with a link to a Qualtrics web survey). Participants reported their normal waking hours, and these hours were divided into 6 blocks. Daily surveys were timed so that one survey was delivered during each time block, and no two surveys were delivered within half an hour of one another. These surveys were prompted 6 times each day for 28 days, and consisted of items related to core affect (valence and arousal), love, meaning of life, accomplishment, and flow. Surveys expired after 60 min to ensure participant compliance within the specified time window. Current analyses focus on the single item assessing self-reported momentary arousal. Participants received payment in accordance with their response rates to EMA prompts and could earn a maximum payment of $200. 1. Psychological well-being. The PERMA-Profiler  was used to quantify five elements of psychological well-being, namely: positive emotion, engagement, relationship satisfaction, meaning of life, and accomplishment, based on  theoretical model. The PERMA-Profiler captures the five PERMA elements as trait-level factors using three items each, such as ""In general, how often do you feel joyful?"" for positive emotion. Items are rated on a Likert scale from 0 = Never to 10 = Always. In the current study, the mean across all domains was taken to represent a single, well-being composite score, with a possible range of 0-10. The PERMA-Profiler has exhibited high internal consistency in prior work , and in the present study (Cronbach's alpha = 0.95). Scores in our sample ranged from 4.56 to 9.56 (M = 7.72; SD = 1.35), and were sample-mean centered to facilitate multilevel modeling. Apparatus Negative emotionality. The PERMA-Profiler was also used to quantify negative emotionality, via three items: ""In general, how often do you feel sad?"", ""In general, how often do you feel anxious?"", and ""In general, how often do you feel angry?"". Items were rated using the same scale as noted above and were averaged across items to create a total score, with a possible range of 0-10. Scores in our sample ranged from 2.00 to 7.67 (M = 4.17; SD = 1.68). Scores were sample-mean centered to facilitate multilevel analyses. Cronbach's alpha was 0.74. Daily measures 3.3.2.1. Self-reported momentary arousal. At each of the 6 daily prompts participants were asked ""How awake/active do you feel right now?"" This item was rated on a visual sliding scale from 0 = Not at all to 100 = Extremely. The overall mean level of arousal across the sample was 69.17 (SD = 13.86).  was used to collect physiological measures of interest, heart rate and electrodermal activity, throughout the 4-week data collection period. Details of collection are described below. Physiological indices of arousal. The Empatica E4 wristband Heart rate (HR). Heart rate estimated from blood volume pulse (BVP) was measured using a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor mounted on the underside of the E4 watch. The E4 PPG sensor uses green and red light. Both the green and red LEDs are oriented towards the skin and absorbed by the blood in different ways, and are combined to optimize maximizing the estimation of heart rate . Measured light during green exposure contains most of the information on HR and is characterized by a sequence of valleys, whose time occurrences are used to estimate the heart beats. Measured light during red exposure contains a reference light level which is used to cancel motion artifacts. Changes in pulse rate are linearly related to the timing of individual heart beats, and are therefore used to estimate HR . BVP was sampled at 64 Hz and a second-by-second estimate of HR was generated for analysis. The overall mean heart rate across the sample was 83.99 (SD = 4.04). Electrodermal activity (EDA). Electrodermal activity was derived from a sensor made of two aluminum nodes mounted on the wristband and resting on the palmar side of the wrist. Changes in electrical potential across the nodes reflect fluctuations in cutaneous sweat glands, which are innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. EDA was sampled at 4 Hz, and a second-by-second time series of EDA level measured in μSiemens was generated for analysis. The overall mean EDA level across the sample was 1.96 (SD = 2.19). Data processing To facilitate alignment with the EMA data, the physiological data streams were downloaded from the Empatica cloud platform and processed using R version 3.6.0 and R Studio version 1.2.1335 (R Core Team, 2019; R Studio Team, 2020). Data processing was performed using the data.table, lubridate, plyr, and zoo packages . First, we filtered out occasions based on physiologically invalid temperature or heart rate data, specifying the same parameters used by . Specifically, we excluded any occasions where the value for temperature was less than 30 degrees Celsius or greater than 43 degrees Celsius, or where the value for heart rate was less than 30 beats per minute or greater than 200 beats per minute. We then isolated the 1-min segment of physiological data immediately preceding the EMA prompt and calculated the arithmetic mean over the entire minute. If valid physiological data were not available for the entire 1-min interval, that interval was treated as missing. Compliance was satisfactory both in terms of E4 wear time and selfreported survey responses. Across the study period, on average, participants reported arousal levels for M = 157.20 (93.57 %) of the EMA prompts they received (SD = 8.39, min = 129, max = 166). We consider missing physiological data only in reference to occasions where EMA data were provided. Across the study period, on average, 122.25 (77.41 %) of EMA prompts responded to by participants had valid physiological data in the 1-minute interval prior to the EMA prompt (SD = 23.77, min = 80, max = 152). On average, participants had complete EMA and physiological data for M = 122.03 (72.64 %) (SD = 23.84, min = 80, max = 152) of the 168 total possible occasions designated by the study protocol. Data analysis All analyses were performed in R version 4.0.0 and R Studio version 1.2.5042 (R Core Team, 2020; R Studio Team, 2020) using the brms package . The brms package implements parameter estimation in the Bayesian framework by calling Stan software . To facilitate analysis of within-person covariation, the processed EDA and HR data were person-mean centered. Specifically, for each person we calculated the mean value of their EDA and HR scores across all occasions preceding an EMA. Then the person-level mean for each marker was subtracted from each raw score for that marker, yielding scores reflecting whether the person's EDA or HR was higher (positive values) or lower (negative values) than their usual on that specific occasion. To answer our research questions of whether coherence between arousal and physiological indices is evident at the daily level, and whether these associations vary based on person-level characteristics, we chose a linear mixed-effects modeling approach fit in the Bayesian framework. This approach enables the ability to examine within-person associations of two variables (self-reports and physiology) while allowing for between person differences in the intercept and slope and inclusion of predictors of between-person differences (well-being, negative emotionality, and gender). A comparable method has been used to assess coherence between physiology and self-reports of emotion in prior work to accommodate time-series data where the self-reports of emotion may not map on to the precise timing of peak physiological arousal . We opted for implementing the models in the Bayesian statistical framework as it is computationally more stable with small sample sizes. In the Bayesian framework we were able to fit the fully specified random effects structure to our data, which was not possible when we attempted to fit the model in the frequentist framework. Failure to include a random slope in the model due to model non-convergence would have meant that the strength of concordance between physiological arousal and self-report arousal could not vary across persons in the sample, which is often not a tenable assumption. In the Bayesian framework, prior probability distributions on the model parameters need to be selected, and may vary in how informative they are-that is, how much influence they have on the result. In our analyses, we used the default priors in the brms package, which are meant to be weakly informative (i.e., they provide a rough scale to the model; . First, we specified base models without person-level predictors to test whether there was coherence between self-reported and physiological arousal indicators. These models were specified as follows: Arousal it = β 0i + β 1i HR it + ε it and Arousal it = β 0i + β 1i EDA it + ε it where β 0i = γ 00 + u 0i β 1i = γ 10 + u 1i where γ 00 is the fixed intercept, representing the average expected level of self-reported arousal in the sample; u 0i is the random effect for the intercept, representing the extent of between-person variability in that intercept; γ 10 is the fixed slope for the physiological variable (EDA or HR) and represents the average effect for individuals in the sample; u 1i is the random effect for the slope, representing the extent of betweenperson variability in the slope of the physiological variable; and ε it stands for some zero mean residual error. We then added person-level predictors, namely well-being, negative emotionality, and gender, into the model in order to assess the extent to which these variables influence both self-reported arousal and coherence between physiological and self-reports of arousal. Arousal it = β 0i + β 1i HR it + ε it and Arousal it = β 0i + β 1i EDA it + ε it where β 0i = γ 00 + γ 01 WellBeing i + γ 02 NegEmotion i + γ 03 Gender i + u 0i β 1i = γ 10 + γ 20 WellBeing i + γ 30 NegEmotion i + γ 40 Gender i + u 1i where γ 01 , γ 02 , and γ 03 represent the main effects of well-being, negative emotionality, and gender, respectively, on arousal; γ 20 , γ 30 , and γ 40 represent the cross-level interactions of well-being, negative emotionality, and gender, respectively, with the physiological variables. The rest of the terms are as defined for the equations above. The interaction effects indicate the extent to which these between-person variables are associated with the within-person coherence between physiological and self-reported arousal. Missing values for one or more predictors on a given occasion are often handled through listwise deletion in a multilevel modeling framework, regardless of whether the model is fit using frequentist or Bayesian statistics. Data were not imputed prior to or during model fitting because we did not have reason to suspect that values were not missing at random in these data. As an assumption check, we calculated the intraclass correlation (ICC) for self-reported arousal to ensure that there was sufficient variability at both the within-and the between-person levels. The ICC was about 0.34, indicating that 34 % of the variation in arousal is due to between-person differences, which leaves the remaining 66 % at the within-person level. We consider this sufficient to continue multilevel modeling on these data. We hypothesized that the physiological measures would be positively associated with self-reported arousal. We further expected that the cross-level interactions would be significant such that higher coherence (or a stronger positive relationship) between the physiological measures and the self-reports of arousal would be associated with greater psychological well-being, lower negative emotionality, and gender (women higher) at the person level. Due to the small sample size to detect between-person effects, the inclusion of person-level predictors is purely exploratory. Results Coherence between heart rate and self-reports Coefficient estimates for the base model estimating the withinperson relationships between HR and self-reported arousal are shown in Table . Model parameters were estimated by calculating distributions that give the most probable values of these parameters, using Monte Carlo algorithms that sample random values from them. These distributions are called posterior distributions and they combine information from the priors (see defined above) and the likelihood function of the data. Two chains of samples, each updating the results of the previous sample, were run, using different starting values. The first 2000 samples from each chain were used to ""warm up"" the sampling algorithm and were discarded afterwards. Another 5000 were run in each chain after warm-up, and these 10,000 samples were used to estimate the mean for a point estimate (shown in column 2), the standard error (based on the standard deviation of the posteriors, column 3) and the lower and upper limits of the central 95 % credible interval (column 4). The true parameter falls in this credible interval with 95 % probability. The intercept, describing the expected level of arousal at a self-report survey for a perfectly average person when all predictors are at mean levels, is just over 70 (γ 00HR = 70.07, SE = 2.93) on a scale from 0 to 100. Between-person differences in this expected level had a standard deviation of just under 15 (u 0iHR = 14.90; SE = 2.32). More importantly, in line with our hypotheses, results revealed coherence between HR and self-reported arousal, such that when individuals experienced elevated heart rate in the one-minute period prior to the EMA survey, they tended to report higher levels of arousal (γ 10HR = 0.23; SE = 0.04). The strength of this association varied between participants (u 1iHR = 0.17; SE = 0.04), as depicted in Fig. . Person-mean centering focuses the plot on the differing within-person associations between physiological and selfreported arousal and does not provide a visualization of between-person variability in the intercept for arousal. Lines with steeper slopes indicate that, for some individuals, this association is much stronger. Lines with shallower slopes indicate that, for some individuals, this association is much weaker. In other words, for some participants, a given increase in physiological arousal results in a greater change in self-reported arousal, while in others the same increase results in a smaller change in selfreported arousal. Next, we added well-being, negative emotionality, and gender to the model in order to examine whether coherence between HR and selfreported arousal was moderated by these person-level predictors. In the full model (Table ), coherence between HR and self-reported arousal was evident even after accounting for person-level predictors (γ 10HR = 0.26; SE = 0.05). There was also a main effect of person-level psychological well-being on arousal, such that individuals with higher levels of psychological well-being generally had higher momentary selfreports of arousal (γ 01HR = 7.78; SE = 1.99). There were no main effects for negative emotionality or gender on self-reported arousal. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find a credible effect on psychological wellbeing on the strength of HR coherence (γ 20HR = − 0.05; SE = 0.04). In addition, there were no credible interaction effects for negative emotionality or gender on the relationship between HR and selfreported arousal (see Table ).   Note. N = 25; CI = 95 % Credible Interval. HR = heart rate. Coherence between electrodermal activity and self-reports Results for the base model estimating the within-person relationships between EDA and self-reported arousal are shown in Table . Similar to the HR models, the intercept was just under 70 (γ 00EDA = 69.87; SE = 2.93), with a standard deviation of just under 15 (u 0iEDA = 14.77; SE = 2.36). Regarding coherence between EDA and self-reported arousal, results revealed that there was a credible association between within-person changes in EDA and self-reports of arousal, such that when individuals' EDA levels were higher than average in the oneminute period prior to the EMA survey, they reported higher levels of arousal (γ 10EDA = 0.68; SE = 0.23). In addition, the strength of this association varied between participants (u 1iEDA = 0.81; SE = 0.22), suggesting substantial individual differences in coherence (Fig. ). To examine whether coherence between self-reported arousal and EDA was moderated by person-level predictors, we added well-being, negative emotionality, and gender to the model. Results (Table ) revealed that after controlling for covariates, evidence of coherence between EDA and self-report arousal remained credible (γ 10EDA = 0.81; SE = 0.28). Consistent with the HR models, there was also a main effect of person-level psychological well-being on arousal, such that individuals with higher levels of psychological well-being had higher momentary self-reports of arousal (γ 01EDA = 7.79; SE = 2.00). There were no main effects for negative emotionality or gender on selfreported arousal. Finally, we did not find credible effects of psychological well-being, negative emotionality, or gender on the strength of EDA coherence. Discussion The present study examined whether coherence between physiological arousal and the subjective experience of arousal can be found in daily life. We used ecologically valid EMA methodology, including smartphone based self-report surveys to assess momentary arousal levels and second-by-second, unobtrusive, in-vivo physiological recording to assess concurrent physiological markers of affective arousal. Results indicated that individuals, on average, displayed coherence between physiology and subjective experience of arousal. Furthermore, findings were consistent across both HR and EDA, suggesting that coherence may manifest in both channels. In addition, we examined whether hypothesized individual differences in between-person baseline factors are related to daily coherence. Our study presents the first analysis of emotion coherence in daily life, and adds to the literature by providing preliminary support that coherence does occur outside of the laboratory in ecologically valid contexts that aim to capture the normative range of emotions and emotional intensity that individuals typically experience. The use of an ecological momentary assessment design allowed us to collect information on people's affective states throughout the course of their normal, daily life, thereby capturing our measures of coherence in a naturalistic setting . Findings dovetail with prior literature that shows evidence of physiology-experience coherence in lab settings , and extends these findings to daily life. Importantly, there were substantial between-person differences in coherence captured in daily life, as evidenced by the random slopes in our models. This suggests that, while on average, individuals display coherence between physiology and self-reports of arousal, there remains a great degree of variation in the extent to which individuals exhibit coherence. By adding cross-level interactions into our model, we sought to attribute this variation in the extent to which individuals experience coherence to certain person-level variables which prior literature suggests to be theoretically important. Accordingly, we tested associations of between individual differences in the degree of coherence in daily life and three person-level predictors that have been associated with coherence in previous studies: well-being, negative emotionality, and gender . It should be noted that given our small sample size, these analyses can be considered as exploratory and should be followed up on in research using larger samples. In our analyses, no evidence of moderation by any of these factors emerged, and as a result, we cannot attribute the variation in the random slopes to these factors in our study. This may relate to the power of the sample to detect between-person   Note. N = 25; CI = 95 % Credible Interval. EDA = electrodermal activity. differences. The study was designed to maximize power to test within-person coherence in daily life, with t = 168 planned repeated measures per person. However, the small number of participants limits power to detect between person effects (N = 25). This is especially the case for gender, as there were only were n = 8 men in our sample. In the Bayesian framework, although we are able to estimate the full random effects structure, we still have limited power to detect between-person differences in associations. It is also possible that our ability to find an association between traitlevel well-being and negative emotionality was limited by the chosen measurements of these constructs. For example, prior work has examined coherence in relation to the Ryff well-being scale , life satisfaction , depression , and Big-Five neuroticism . We used a multi-dimensional measure of well-being, namely, the PERMA index, along with the PERMA scale of negative emotionality, which is relatively similar theoretically to other measures of well-being used in prior research on coherence (e.g., Ryff well-being scale; . However, it is possible that the PERMA indices of well-being tap into a different construct than measured in prior research. To examine this idea, the analysis was repeated with additional measures of well-being: the Satisfaction with Life Scale  and the SF-36 Emotional Well-Being subscale . Results (included in supplemental material) were largely consistent with our findings using PERMA. This disagreement with the literature suggests that coherence in the context of daily life may not have immediate implications for well-being, or at least that its impact on well-being is nonlinear; although further research is needed to examine whether these results generalize to larger samples. Measurement of coherence in the daily-life context captures a much broader picture of emotion coherence than a laboratory-based assessment. Lab-based studies of coherence tend to measure specific emotional states, typically experiences of strong negative affect designed to assess reactivity to more extreme emotional experiences (e.g., anger; fear). The extent to which individuals feel these more extreme emotions in daily life is unclear. By assessing individuals across 28 days, we maximize the probability of capturing a wide range of emotional experiences, but also include experiences of mild emotional intensity. It is possible that coherence across the full gradient of emotional intensity is not related to psychological well-being, but rather only the extent to which individuals experience emotional coherence in the context of more aversive, more intense, or less ambiguous emotional experiences reflects an adaptive emotional process. It is also possible that the adaptive value of coherence varies situationally. The notion that coherence across emotion channels is inherently adaptive may be incongruent with models of emotion regulation that promote an active decoupling between physiological reactivity and subjective state through cognitive reappraisal , and/or between physiological reactivity and behavior through inhibitory control . It may be that daily life contexts require flexibility in emotion coherence such that well-being is promoted when individuals' coherence is situationally appropriate, with the ability to decouple emotion across levels when needed. For instance, in a laboratory setting, emotion induction is frequently achieved through watching a film-a context in which the circumstances are not personally-relevant and require no behavioral response. Coherence in this setting may reflect an adaptive attunement to one's emotional experiences. In daily contexts, individuals are often called upon to behave in ways that are potentially incongruent with their emotional state, such as being nice to a co-worker that has made them angry or smiling through a job interview despite being nervous. It may be adaptive in these situations for one to be less attuned to their physiological arousal in order to regulate their emotional experience. Future EMA studies could collect more contextual information in order to examine the conditions in which greater coherence is or is not beneficial. It is worth noting that there may additionally be between-person moderators of the extent to which coherence is associated with wellbeing. Some research indicates that emotion coherence may be moderated by cultural factors that may shape participants' emotional display norms, labeling of physiological states, or willingness to disclose subjective emotional state in ways that lead to discontinuity between physiological responses to emotion conditions and the behavioral and subjective manifestations of emotion . These cultural effects suggest that coherence may be associated with well-being only in cultural environments where emotional expression is valued and accepted, whereas less coherence may be more adaptive in cultural contexts where expression is discouraged. Thus, future research could examine the extent to which individuals' identities and beliefs about emotional expression (e.g., belief that ""boys shouldn't cry"") moderate the extent to which coherence has adaptive implications. Researchers have argued for the need for psychophysiological research to attend to the effects of factors like culture and gender in moderating how physiological processes relate to psychological function rather than presuming that findings generalize to all humans (Gatzke-Kopp, 2016). Finally, it is possible that daily coherence may be linked to daily measures of well-being, rather than trait-based measures of well-being. In laboratory settings participants typically complete the trait-based questionnaire on the same day that coherence is assessed, whereas in our study, participants completed a baseline measure, and were then followed for 28 days. Although trait-based well-being measures ask participants to provide ratings that capture how they feel ""in general"", research has found that purportedly stable constructs, such as life satisfaction, can demonstrate considerable short-term variability . Thus, the measurement of momentary well-being and negative emotionality would be a fruitful avenue for future research on daily coherence, as well as further consideration of what functional outcomes of adaptation may be most relevant for daily coherence per theoretical accounts. Taken together, our findings suggest that coherence between physiology and self-reports of arousal can be measured in daily life, and that coherence may be evident in more ecologically valid settings, thereby extending lab-based coherence research to the daily arena. Furthermore, there was some evidence for individual variation in coherence, underscoring the importance of continued research to identify what individual difference factors may account for these differences, and how individual differences in coherence at the daily level may impact functional outcomes. Limitations and future directions Our study presents with several strengths, including high power detect within-person effects, the use of an ecologically valid design, and in-vivo physiological recording to capture coherence in daily life. Nonetheless, several limitations warrant mention. First, although we had a large sample size to test our main hypothesis about coherence within-persons, our between-person sample size was small, limiting our power to detect between-person effects. Thus, it is possible that future studies with larger sample sizes may be able to identify moderation of coherence by well-being, negative emotionality, or gender, as has been found in prior lab studies (e.g., . Second, although the use of wearable physiology sensors enabled us to test our hypotheses in an ecologically valid manner, levels of physiological activity recorded with wearable devices do differ from activity recorded with standard laboratory equipment , and may have accounted for the discrepancies with previous studies. Further, the use of self-reported arousal as our emotion measure limits our ability to test whether findings would generalize to specific affective experiences (e.g., anger; sadness) in daily life. In addition, the use of a one-item measure to assess the subjective experience of arousal via self-reports= can be a double-edged sword-while it has the advantage of increasing participant compliance, it may have limited reliability. Finally, measures of HR and EDA do not by themselves provide insight into emotional processes such as valence, motivational orientation, or mental effort. Accordingly, our conclusions regarding coherence are limited to the arousal dimension of affective responses. Limitations notwithstanding, our study provides a novel contribution to the literature by testing coherence in daily life in an ecologically valid manner. Conclusion The present study utilized ambulatory physiological measures and ecological momentary assessment conducted over a 4-week period to examine the extent to which emotional experience and physiology covary in daily life, and whether individual differences moderate this relationship. Results revealed that, on average, individuals exhibited coherence between subjective experience of emotional arousal and physiology, but there was significant between-person variation in the extent of this coherence. However, we were not able to credibly link the variation in coherence to individual differences in well-being, negative emotionality, or gender. Findings contribute to the literature by providing a novel methodological approach to measuring coherence in daily life and add credence to theoretical accounts of emotion coherence by demonstrating the generalizability of coherence to the daily context. Future research should continue to build on this work by examining between-person effects in larger samples, corroborating daily measures with lab measures, and measuring specific affective states.

6,6,Characterizing nicotine exposure among a community sample of non-daily smokers in the United States,"Background: Over one-quarter of all smokers in the United States identify as non-daily smokers and this number is projected to rise. Unlike daily smokers who typically maintain consistent levels of nicotine exposure with regular smoking, non-daily smokers have variable patterns of smoking that likely result in high intraindividual variability in nicotine intake. The current study aimed to characterize the weekly intraindividual variability in cotinine and identify smoking-related predictors in nondaily smokers. Methods: An ecological momentary assessment of 60 non-daily smokers ages 24-57 years was conducted over a consecutive 7-day at-home protocol to log each smoking session, assessments of mood and social activity during smoking, and collection of daily saliva samples in a convenience sample from Pennsylvania, USA. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the effects of smoking characteristics on total cotinine exposure measured by pharmacokinetic area under the curve and the range, maximum, and minimum cotinine values during the week controlling for demographic variables. Results: The mean daily cotinine level was 119.2 ng/ml (SD = 168.9) with individual values that ranged from nondetectable to 949.6 ng/ml. Menthol predicted increased total cotinine levels (P < 0.05). Shorter time to the first cigarette of the day predicted significantly higher minimum (P < 0.05), maximum (P < 0.05), and total cotinine values (P < 0.05) after controlling for covariates. Negative emotions and social interactions with others were also significantly associated with higher cotinine metrics. There was no significant effect of the nicotine metabolite ratio.Conclusions: Our findings highlight the variability in nicotine exposure across days among non-daily smokers and point to the role of smoking context in nicotine exposure. The findings suggest the need to develop better assessment methods to determine health and dependence risk and personalized cessation interventions for this heterogeneous and growing group of smokers.","[""Non-daily smokers"", ""Nicotine exposure"", ""Nicotine dependence"", ""Cotinine"", ""Smoking behavior""]",10.1186/s12889-021-11052-9,"Background In the United States, the prevalence of cigarette smoking decreased from 21% in 2005 to 14% in 2017 . Accordingly, the number of non-daily smokers is expected to rise as tobacco use becomes more expensive and restricted in the U. S . Approximately one-quarter to one-third of all smokers in the U.S. identify as non-daily smokers who do not smoke a cigarette every day . While non-daily smoking is linked to fewer health risks than daily smoking, non-daily smokers still have substantially higher rates of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease than the general population . National trends suggest that low frequency smokers are becoming more nicotine dependent than in the past, possibly because this group comprises former heavy smokers . A large national survey found that non-daily smokers were more likely to make a quit attempt and maintain abstinence at 90 days than daily smokers . However, the rates of abstinence for non-daily smokers with and without a prior history of daily smoking are still quite low, 27 and 18% respectively, especially considering that approximately half of non-daily smokers are not nicotine dependent . Thus, non-daily use still puts smokers at risk for adverse health outcomes. Nicotine is the primary psychoactive component in cigarettes and the main driver of cigarette dependence . Although nicotine itself is not carcinogenic and makes only minor contributions to the development of cardiovascular disease, nicotine exposure can serve as a biomarker of negative health outcomes since it increases in parallel with other toxins and chemicals in cigarette smoke . Nicotine, and its metabolite cotinine, can be measured in blood, saliva, and urine, making it an accessible and reliable predictor of disease risk and dependence . Despite the rising prevalence of non-daily smoking in the U.S., we still know little about the levels, consistency, and correlates of nicotine exposure for non-daily smokers. One study sampled urinary cotinine at a single time point and found levels to be nearly three times lower among nondaily (aka., intermittent) compared to daily smokers . The amount of exposure per cigarette was similar for daily and non-daily smokers in this study . Not surprisingly, non-daily smokers have lower levels of nicotine dependence than daily smokers . This finding has been replicated across different facets of dependence, including behavioral measures of dependence such as smoking motives, and self-perceived loss of autonomy over smoking . Given the lower levels of nicotine exposure, smoking for non-daily smokers may be even more dependent on environmental and internal stimuli such as mood, activity, and social setting than for daily smokers . Our previous report using ecological momentary assessments among non-daily smokers found that smoking was most likely to occur during positive moods and leisure activities compared to negative and neutral mood states or performative and social activities . Smoke intake, however, is not the only determinant of nicotine exposure for smokers. For example, compared to white smokers, black smokers have higher nicotine metabolite levels per cigarette . This racial difference becomes even more pronounced with fewer cigarettes smoked per day . A similar effect has also been found for menthol compared to regular tobacco smokers . Even mood state, such as positive affect, has been linked to increased nicotine boosts during cigarette smoking . We still have a limited understanding of what factors influence nicotine exposure for non-daily smokers, and if nicotine exposure is moderated by demographic and smoking factors, like race and flavor preference, as it is for daily smokers. Unlike daily smokers that typically maintain consistent levels of blood nicotine to avoid withdrawal symptoms, non-daily smokers report a wide range in the number of cigarettes they smoke per day and the number of days of abstinence between smoking days . Thus, non-daily smokers are a heterogeneous group that may have high variability in their day-to-day nicotine exposure . In other words, the cotinine value on one day may be considerably different to the value on another day. Therefore, it is important to study intraindividual differences in nicotine exposure, including total exposure and consistency in exposure across time, to obtain an accurate picture of nicotine exposure for non-daily smokers. Our primary aims for the current study were to: 1) characterize the intraindividual variability in nicotine exposure for non-daily smokers, and 2) identify demographic and smoking factors associated with nicotine exposure for non-daily smokers. To accomplish these aims, we measured salivary cotinine from non-daily smokers over a 7 day collection period. While mean level of daily nicotine exposure is a meaningful metric for understanding true nicotine exposure for daily smokers, non-daily smokers, on the other hand, likely have more variability in day-to-day nicotine exposure. A one time single day measure of cotinine not only fails to capture the day-to-day variability, but may also provide an inaccurate view of the true nicotine exposure by not accounting for days when no cigarettes were smoked. To overcome this challenge, we used four different metrics to characterize intraindividual differences in nicotine exposure, including area under the curve (AUC) to capture total weekly exposure, maximum and minimum daily values to capture level of exposure on any 1 day, and the range of daily values to measure consistency of exposure across days. We then identified demographic, smoking, and contextual-related correlates of nicotine exposure to explore potential predictors and outcomes of tobacco exposure for non-daily smokers. Methods Participant recruitment Non-daily smokers (n = 60) in the United States were recruited as a sub-sample of the Pennsylvania Adult Smoking Study (PASS) . The PASS study investigated whether socioeconomic status predicts smoke exposure in daily smokers , and the current sub-study was designed to observe factors related to smoking for non-daily smokers specifically. Online advertisements, flyers, and peer-referrals were used for recruitment from 2014 to 2015. Participants were eligible if they reported smoking 4-24 days out of the past 30, and had this pattern for at least 6 months. Interested individuals were excluded if they reported that > 50% of their tobacco use was a product other than a cigarette, were currently pregnant, or engaged in active cessation attempts. Procedures If eligible after phone screening, participants were invited to an initial in-person visit where they provided written informed consent and completed a battery of questionnaires that included measures of nicotine dependence. During a 7-day at-home protocol, participants completed daily smoking logs, measures of smoking topography, ecological momentary assessments (EMA) during each smoking session (described below), and collected one saliva sample at approximately the same time each day for nicotine metabolite analysis. Participants returned all logs, topography equipment, and saliva samples at a final visit following the 7-day collection period. Topography data is not presented in this manuscript and a thorough description of the emotions and activities reported using EMA during each cigarette session has been published . REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) tools hosted at the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center and College of Medicine were used for all data collection and management . All study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Penn State College of Medicine (037860EP). Salivary cotinine Participants provided daily saliva samples for nicotine metabolite analysis. Cotinine has a longer half-life compared to nicotine, approximately 16 h for cotinine versus 2 h for nicotine, making it a sensitive measure of smoking even among light and non-daily smokers . For daily saliva collection, participants placed a SalivaBio Oral Swab (Salimetrics, State College, Pennsylvania) under their tongues for 2 min. Participants stored the swabs in their home freezer until the final data collection visit. Swabs were kept frozen (− 80 °C) in the laboratory until High Sensitivity Salivary Cotinine Quantitative Enzyme Immunoassay (ELISA; Salimetrics, State College, Pennsylvania) was carried out as directed by the manufacturer for the total sample. For 17 participants, immunoassay results were compared to assays conducted using mass spectrometry methods previously described  and modified for increased dilution in saliva samples using Triple TOF 5600 (AB SCIEX, Concord, Ontario, Canada). The same mass spectrometry methods were used to calculate cotinine and trans-3′-hydroxycotinine (3HC) on each participant's initial saliva sample to determine nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), calculated as 3HC divided by cotinine. Continuous NMR values were log transformed for analysis. Similar to previous studies, participants in the lowest quartile of NMR values (≤0.31) were categorized as slow metabolizers and those in the top three quartiles as normal metabolizers . To determine the reliability of cotinine over the course of a single day for non-daily smokers, six participants provided four extra saliva samples (5 total) three to four hours apart on 1 day. These were analyzed using immunoassay. Baseline assessment Participants provided basic demographic information and detailed smoking histories. Those who answered ""yes"" to the question ""Have you ever smoked daily for 6 months or longer?"" were categorized as a ""converted"" non-daily smoker (i.e., converted to non-daily smoking from daily smoking) and those who answered no were categorized as a ""native"" non-daily smoker, as has been done in prior research . The Hooked on Nicotine Checklist (HONC) measured loss of perceived autonomy over smoking using 10-items that assess past recall of withdrawal, craving, and quit attempts (e.g., Do you ever have strong cravings to smoke?) . HONC scores range from 0 (low) to 10 (high) and internal consistency was good in the current sample as expected (Cronbach's α = 0.70). The HONC is more sensitive to dependence among very light smokers, likely because the score is not weighted heavily by the number of cigarettes smoked per day like other dependence measures . While the HONC was developed for a dichotomous scoring system with any item endorsement indicating loss of autonomy over smoking , we measured it as a continuous marker of the degree of autonomy as has been done previously with non-daily smokers . Event-level assessment At each ad-lib smoking session, participants answered a series of questions about their current emotion, activity, time of day, urge, if they were alone, and if they were currently consuming alcohol. Activities were coded into four categories: leisure (e.g., watching TV, at home, on the computer, and drinking coffee), performative (e.g., completing chores, driving, getting child ready for school), social (e.g., at a party, at a friend's home, at the casino), and interactive (e.g., talking on the phone, arguing with another, business calls, and having a conversation). Emotions were categorized as: positive, negative, neutral, and mixed. The details of these categories, reliability of the coding procedure, and results of the EMA analysis are described in a prior publication . Data analysis Patterns of daily cotinine Data were analyzed using R statistical software (version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05)) and SPSS (version 26). We calculated four descriptive metrics of daily cotinine including the area under the curve (AUC), maximum exposure, minimum exposure, and range of daily values. The AUC is a pharmacokinetic measure that represents total drug exposure over time. AUC for total nicotine exposure during the week was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method. The cotinine range provided a measure of consistency in cotinine values during the week and was calculated as the minimum value subtracted from the maximum value. We divided the sample into tertiles based on the mean cotinine value and plotted each participant's seven daily cotinine values to show graphically the variability in cotinine levels across days and participants (see Fig. ). Associations of cotinine metrics with smoking characteristics, dependence, and activities and emotions Cotinine metrics (AUC, min, max, range) were regressed onto predictor variables including demographics, smoking characteristics, activities, and emotions in separate hierarchical linear regression Covariates included age, sex, race, total family annual income, and marital status. Significance level was set at p-value <.05, and we also applied a Bonferroni correction under the assumption of multiple hypothesis testing where significance level was set at p-value <.003. Results Sample characteristics and tobacco use patterns The sample included 60 non-daily smokers ages 24 to 57 years, who were predominantly white (78%) and non-Hispanic (90%) with an average total family income of $49,414 and more than a high school degree (82%). Approximately half of the total sample was female (52%) and married or living with a partner (45%). Participants reported smoking a mean of 3.2 (SD = 1.8) cigarettes per day and 13.9 (SD = 5.3) days out of the past 30. The mean age of smoking onset was 19.5 (SD = 5.3) years, and the mean duration of nondaily smoking was 8.1 (SD = 7.4) years. Sixty percent of the sample converted from daily smoking to non-daily smoking. The converted non-daily smokers reported switching from daily smoking 6.7 (SD = 7.1) years ago on average, and previously smoking daily for a mean of 8.8 (SD = 7.4) years. Thirty-two participants (53%) endorsed use of menthol cigarettes and 62% reported a lifetime quit attempt. The sample reported smoking an average of 424.3 min after waking (SD = 286.7). The mean HONC dependence score was 4.1 (SD = 2.1). Cotinine metrics Participants were grouped into tertiles based on their mean cotinine values to illustrate the variability of cotinine within and between participants (Fig. ). The sample had a mean daily cotinine value of 119.2 ng/ml (SD = 168.9) with daily values that ranged from nondetectable to 949.6 ng/ml. The mean range was 113.6 (SD = 110.5). The mean AUC was 690.8 (SD = 969.7). The mean nicotine metabolite ratio (3HC/cotinine) was 0.6 (SD = 0.4), and 25% (n = 15) of the sample was categorized as a slow metabolizer with a ratio ≤ 0.3. Figure  displays singleday repeated cotinine values (ng/ml) for the six participants randomly selected to collect five repeated cotinine samples over the course of a single day. Overall, the single-day cotinine values remained stable, especially when mean values were less than 50 ng/ml. Linear hierarchical regression analyses Biological and behavioral smoking characteristics Controlling for demographic variables, shorter time to the first cigarette of the day was associated with significantly higher min, max, and AUC cotinine values (Table ). Preference for menthol cigarettes was associated with significantly higher min, max and AUC  Smoking activities and emotions In total, the sample reported 561 smoking experiences and their associated emotions and activities. On the smoking logs, participants reported an average of 3.8 (SD = 1.8) days of smoking during the collection week and 2.4 (SD = 1.4) cigarettes per smoking day. Three participants reported one instance of using a tobacco product other than a cigarette (i.e., electronic cigarette, snuff, and hookah), one participant reported two instances of cigar use, and one participant reported 19 instances of electronic cigarette use during the collection week. All results remained the same with the latter participant excluded from analysis. reported being alone for 58.9% and using alcohol for 23.5% of all reported experiences of tobacco use. The sample reported engaging in leisure activities during smoking most often (n = 272, 48.5%) followed by performative (n = 161, 28.7%), social (n = 90, 16.0%), and interactive (n = 38, 6.8%) activities. The sample reported experiencing positive emotions during smoking most often (n = 262, 46.7%), followed by negative (n = 179, 31.9%), neutral (n = 91, 16.2%), and mixed (n = 29, 5.2%) emotions. Controlling for demographic variables, more interactive activities and negative emotions were associated with significantly higher min, max, range and AUC cotinine measures (Table ). More positive emotions was significantly associated with a higher range in cotinine values.   Discussion The current study measured nicotine exposure over a 7day collection period among a sample of non-daily smokers. There was considerable variation in cotinine levels across participants and between days with some subjects showing consistent low levels day to day and others showing higher and more variable patterns. Intraday variation was low among the five randomly selected participants who took multiple measurements in a single day. The variability in nicotine exposure in our sample map onto a prior study that conducted a latent class analysis among college students' smoking behavior . This study found three classes of non-daily smokers, including a group who smoked several cigarettes a day on more than half the days in a month, a group who smoked several cigarettes a day primarily in social situations on the weekends, and a group who only occasionally smoked all or part of a cigarette . This study did not measure nicotine exposure, but one could expect that cotinine values for these three groups would look similar to our tertiles, with relatively high, but variable levels in the first group, moderate cotinine levels on few days of the week in the second group, and consistently low levels in the last group. Since nicotine levels correlate with other biomarkers of tobacco-related carcinogens and toxins in daily smokers , non-daily smokers might also experience varying levels of harmful exposure. Some non-daily smokers had high levels of cotinine that were similar to that in daily smokers, while others maintained very low levels throughout the entire week. Those participants who reached high cotinine values on a single day tended to have more variability in their levels throughout the week. A review of the health effects of smokers who smoke just a few cigarettes per day indicated that harm occurs even at low levels of smoking and it can be inferred that nondaily smokers also are at increased risk . Cotinine measures were not associated with loss of autonomy. The HONC scores in the current study were similar to that reported for other non-daily smokers . In addition, nicotine exposure was not higher for converted compared to native daily smokers, which have also been shown to have higher rates of nicotine dependence . All cotinine metrics were associated with time to first cigarette after waking. Shorter time to first cigarette after waking is one of the strongest predictors of higher nicotine dependence severity among daily smokers and has previously been associated with cotinine levels for daily smokers . The findings confirm that non-daily smokers are a heterogenous group with varying levels of nicotine dependence. In our sample, menthol preference predicted higher minimum cotinine values throughout the week. Menthol smoking was also related to higher AUC and maximum cotinine values, although these predictors did not reach statistical significance with Bonferroni correction. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that the use of menthol cigarettes is more common among low income smokers and related to higher levels of dependence . Although there are some reports that menthol is associated with higher nicotine intake in daily smokers, an FDA review did not confirm this finding . Among our sample, menthol smoking was not associated with higher scores on the HONC in a post-hoc analysis (p = 0.30). Our EMA results from the current study and a prior analysis of the sample found that smoking occurred most frequently during positive moods and activities of leisure . Non-daily smokers have stronger stimulus control over their smoking habits than daily smokers . Stimulus control occurs when a smokers' mood, activity, and environmental context become important predictors of smoking behavior, rather than nicotine withdrawal alone . This could explain why our participants with low levels of nicotine exposure still reported perceived symptoms of nicotine dependence (e.g., mean HONC = 4.1). We found that these contextual factors were also important predictors of cotinine in our sample. Smoking during interactive activities and negative emotional states was related to higher min, max, and AUC cotinine values. Positive emotions were linked with more variability in nicotine exposure across days. This could have several explanations. Given the relatively higher levels of dependence among this group, these smokers may experience withdrawal symptoms that induce negative emotions, like irritability and anxiety, which precede and then accompany their next smoking experience. Another potential explanation is that our participants with high cotinine levels may smoke to alleviate perceived stress. Experimentally induced stress has been shown to trigger negative affect and craving among heavy and light smokers and is commonly reported as a barrier to cessation . Future research exploring real-time smoking motives among non-daily smokers may help to elucidate why negative emotions are associated with higher cotinine levels for this group and how we might intervene on these emotions to reduce smoking behavior (see  for review). The current study had several limitations. The sample, comprised primarily of non-Hispanic White smokers, was not nationally representative. For this reason our results may not generalize to Black and Hispanic smokers who are known to have higher rates of non-daily smoking than the general population . In addition, our EMA relied on participants' initiative to record each smoking session and some participants may have underreported the number of cigarettes smoked; however, the sample's self-reported CPD was consistent with prior studies of adults and adolescents . Finally, our study was underpowered to detect small effects and may have missed meaningful associations. For example, lower total family income was associated with higher cotinine exposure, but was not significant. Future research with larger, representative samples will help clarify the relevance of these associations with nicotine exposure for nondaily smokers. Conclusions The current study highlights that nicotine exposure as measured by cotinine among non-daily smokers is as variable as their self-reported patterns of smoking behavior. Nicotine exposure for non-daily smokers varies with behavioral measures of dependence (i.e., time to first cigarette) and contextual factors that have also been found with samples of daily smokers. With a wide range in nicotine exposure and consistently low nicotine dependence and cessation rates, some non-daily smokers may not fit with the long-held theory that nicotine is the primary factor that sustains smoking addiction . Instead, these findings point to the need for more detailed assessments of smoking behavior to guide the development of effective cessation interventions for this variable group of smokers. Future research could inform our limited understanding of the biobehavioral mechanisms that contribute to individual differences in nicotine exposure among non-daily smokers and inform the development of personalized interventions that help non-daily smokers manage internal and external cues for smoking.

7,7,Daily variation in sleep characteristics in individuals with and without post traumatic stress disorder,"Background: Sleep disturbances are common in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, little is known about how daily variation in sleep characteristics is related to PTSD. This study examined the nightto-night and weekday versus weekend variation in sleep duration, sleep quality, trouble falling asleep, and difficulty staying asleep in individuals with and without PTSD.Methods: Participants (N = 157; 80 with PTSD, 77 without PTSD) completed daily self-reports of their nighttime sleep characteristics for 15 consecutive days. Linear mixed models were used to examine the associations between the 7 days of the week and weekday versus weekend variation in sleep characteristics and PTSD.Results: Individuals with PTSD reported shorter sleep duration, lower sleep quality, more trouble falling asleep, and more difficulty staying asleep than individuals without PTSD. The pattern of change across the week and between weekdays and weekends was different between those with and without PTSD for sleep quality and trouble falling asleep. Among those with PTSD, sleep duration, sleep quality, and trouble falling asleep differed across the 7 days of the week and showed differences between weekdays and weekends. For those without PTSD, only sleep duration differed across the 7 days of the week and showed differences between weekdays and weekends. Neither group showed 7 days of the week nor weekday versus weekend differences in difficulty staying asleep. Conclusions: On average those with PTSD had shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality, and greater trouble falling and staying asleep. In particular, the day of week variation in sleep quality and trouble falling asleep specifically distinguishes those with PTSD from those without PTSD. Our findings suggest that clinical care might be improved by assessments of sleep patterns and disturbances across at least a week, including weekdays and weekends. Future studies should explore the mechanisms related to the patterns of sleep disturbance among those with PTSD.","[""Sleep"", ""Symptom assessment"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Military personnel""]",10.1186/s12888-021-03282-3,"Background Sleep disturbances are common in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) . Up to 92% of those with PTSD have reported at least one sleep disturbance in both general population and military samples . Individuals with PTSD are more likely to have a shorter sleep duration  and report poor sleep quality  compared to those without PTSD. Having trouble falling asleep and difficulty staying asleep (the predominant symptoms of insomnia) are part of the diagnosis of PTSD  and are among the most frequently reported symptoms of post traumatic stress . Examining the day of week (DOW) patterns in sleep disturbances in those with and without PTSD may aid in understanding the fundamental mechanisms and possible treatments for PTSD. Several studies have examined the relationship between sleep disturbances and next day PTSD symptoms in populations with PTSD . Sleep duration, sleep quality, trouble falling asleep, and difficulty staying asleep were generally associated with next day PTSD symptoms . These studies provide some evidence that variation in sleep disturbances across time was high among individuals with PTSD. For instance, 58 and 63% of the variance in sleep duration and sleep quality, respectively, were due to within-person change . To our knowledge, no studies have specifically looked at DOW variation in sleep characteristics among individuals with PTSD. Daily assessment of sleep across time (e.g., ""How many hours of sleep did you get last night?"") as opposed to retrospective mean assessment of sleep across time (e.g., ""During the past month, how many hours of sleep did you get at night?""), can provide information about how sleep changes over time. Methods of repeated experience sampling including ecological momentary assessments (EMA) and daily sleep diaries are well-suited to assessing symptom change over time . Examination of DOW variation in sleep and sleep disturbances is likely to better capture the impact of situational factors such as work schedules, threat cues, and lifestyle factors. Differences in sleep have, in general, been examined in two ways, by looking at mean change over time and intraindividual variability. In this study, we focus on change over time of sleep characteristics and how the pattern of variation may distinguish PTSD from non-PTSD. Specifically, we examined variation in sleep disturbances across the 7 days of the week and in weekdays versus weekends in individuals with and without PTSD. Understanding the pattern of sleep characteristics across the week may aid in distinguishing diagnoses, improve our understanding of the mechanisms of disorder, inform development of treatment interventions, and suggest possible causes of variation such as weekday versus weekend lifestyle factors (e.g., work, leisure activities, social support). Therefore, in this paper we examined the DOW variation of sleep duration, sleep quality, trouble falling asleep, and difficulty staying asleep in individuals with and without PTSD. Sleep characteristics were assessed by daily self-report for 15 consecutive days. Linear mixed models were used to examine each of the four sleep characteristics across the 7 days of the week and for weekdays versus weekends. We anticipated that sleep characteristics would be worse (shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality, more trouble falling and staying asleep) among those with PTSD compared to those without PTSD, but had no expectations about the relationship between daily or weekday versus weekend variation in sleep characteristics and PTSD. Methods Participants Participants were N = 183 current and former U.S. Service members. A total of n = 157 were included in data analyses, n = 14 did not return the daily assessments, n = 10 did not provide three or more daily assessments of sleep, n = 1 did not complete the assessment of probable PTSD in the pre-questionnaire, and n = 1 was removed as an outlier. This study was part of a larger data collection project examining post traumatic stress in U.S. military personnel. Methods common to the larger project have been reported in prior publications  and are included in Supplement 1. The research was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland. Informed consent was obtained after the procedures were explained and participation was voluntary. Procedure and measures Recruitment and enrollment screening Participants were recruited from a military treatment facility and completed a 26-item screening questionnaire (see Supplement 1). Assessment of PTSD Once enrolled, we determined probable PTSD. Participants completed a 79-item assessment of exposure to traumatic events (see Supplement 1). All participants had at least one qualifying traumatic exposure. Participants also completed the 20-item PTSD Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition (PCL-5; DSM-5) . The PCL-5 assessed DSM-5 PTSD clusters B (intrusion: items 1-5), C (avoidance: items 6-7), D (negative cognitions/ mood: items , and E (hyperarousal: items . Two of the 20 items are related to sleep disturbance (""Repeated, disturbing dreams of the stressful experience"" and ""Trouble falling or staying asleep""). Each item had four response choices, 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Extremely), and the symptom severity score range was 0-80. The PCL-5 has demonstrated good internal consistency (α = .96), test-retest reliability (r = .84), and convergent and discriminant validity in Service member populations . A diagnosis of probable PTSD was made by considering each item rated 2 (Moderately) or higher as an endorsed symptom, then following the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria requiring one or more cluster A traumatic exposures, one or more items from clusters B and C, two or more items from clusters D and E, and a symptom severity score of 38 or higher . Of the N = 157 participants, n = 80 met criteria for probable PTSD (hereafter referred to as those with PTSD) and n = 77 did not meet criteria for PTSD. Daily assessments For the following 15 days, participants completed four assessments per day using an EMA methodology, including an assessment of sleep characteristics on the first assessment of each day (see Supplement 1). The first 39 consecutive subjects (24.8%) completed daily assessments on paper questionnaires (Phase 1) and the next 118 subjects (75.2%) completed the same assessments on an Apple Inc. iPad 2 with a software application designed specifically for use in this study (Phase 2). The phase of the study was controlled for all analyses and was not a significant covariate. In total, N = 1994 sleep assessments were collected. Of those, n = 47 (2.4%) were dropped from data analysis because they were completed too early (n = 15), too late (n = 18), were missing the completion date or time (n = 13), or due to an irreconcilable error in electronic data (n = 1). Of the N = 1947 assessments included in the analyses, n = 1482 (76.1%) were completed within 0-2 h, n = 331 (17.0%) within 2-4 h, and n = 134 (6.9%) within 4-6 h of the 6-h assessment completion window. The overall adherence rate (i.e., percentage completed out of 2355 possible sleep assessments) was 82.7% in the present sample. Sleep characteristics Sleep duration was assessed with one item adapted from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) , ""How many hours of actual sleep did you get last night? (This may be different than the number of hours you spent in bed)."" Participants wrote in the number of hours of sleep and, if necessary, responses were rounded to the nearest quarter hour (see Supplement 1 for details of the sleep measures). Sleep quality was assessed with one item adapted from the PSQI, ""How would you rate your sleep quality overall last night?"" Response choices ranged from 0 (Very bad) to 3 (Very good), with high scores reflecting better sleep quality. Trouble falling asleep was assessed with three items and difficulty staying asleep was assessed with six items, and these nine items were adapted from the PCL-5 , PSQI , SLEEP-50  or developed for use in this study by the authors (RJU & CSF). Item instructions were ""Below is a list of sleep problems. Please fill in the bubble according to what you experienced last night."" Response choices were 0 (No) and 1 (Yes). Cronbach's alpha internal reliability, assessed at the person level, was acceptable or good for trouble falling asleep (α = 0.63) and difficulty staying asleep (α = 0.72). The mean of the items within the trouble falling asleep dimension and the difficulty staying asleep dimension was used in the analyses, indicating the percent of the sleep problem that the participant experienced during the previous night (range = 0-1), with high score reflecting more trouble falling asleep or more difficulty staying asleep. DOW and weekday/weekend variables A 7-day and a dichotomous weekday (Monday through Friday)/weekend (Saturday and Sunday) variable were created to test if the four sleep characteristics differed by the day of the week. The previous night's sleep characteristics were reported on the first assessment of the following day (e.g., Saturday and Sunday's report captured the sleep characteristics of Friday and Saturday night's sleep). Data analyses DOW variation in sleep characteristics was assessed using linear mixed models with daily assessments (Level-1) nested within subjects (Level-2). The first-order autoregression assumption (AR ) was compared to compound symmetry and was selected for within-subject residuals for all analyses (see Supplement 2 for further details). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was provided to identify the proportion of variance due to Level 1 and Level 2 in the analysis (see Supplement 2). We first examined whether each sleep characteristic varied across the 7 days of the week or between weekdays versus weekends in the total sample and in individuals with and without PTSD. The total group analyses allowed us to examine sleep characteristic differences by PTSD group controlling for DOW and demographic covariates. The stratified analyses explored the DOW variation in individuals with PTSD, our group of primary interest, and provided a comparison to those without PTSD. We then examined whether participants with and without PTSD differed in each sleep characteristic across the 7 days of the week or between weekdays versus weekends by testing the interaction of PTSD group and DOW. Due to the low statistical power to detect crosslevel interaction effects in mixed models , we were aware that the interaction analysis was informative but limited. In the 7 DOW analyses the Tukey-Kramer method was used to adjust for multiple pairwise comparisons. Sex, age, race, education, and phase of the study (paper versus electronic) were included as covariates. Mixed model analyses were conducted in PC SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). To determine the specific statistical power of our sample to detect the DOW difference as a within-subject predictor and PTSD group difference as a betweensubject predictor, a series of Monte Carlo simulation post-hoc power analyses were conducted . Results showed a high statistical power to detect a significant within-subject predictor, but a relatively low power for a between-subject predictor. For example, for sleep duration, at a power of 80% with 77 individuals (the smaller group size in the current study) and a mean of 12 observations per individual, we are able to detect a weekday versus weekend difference of .23 standard deviations, which can be considered a small effect size. A significant between-subject predictor (e.g., PTSD group) in an analysis of 157 individuals would require an effect size of .43 standard deviations, which can be considered a medium effect size. Post-hoc power analyses were conducted in Mplus version 7.11 . Results Sample demographics and descriptive statistics Demographics and descriptive statistics are shown in Table . Mean age of participants in the analytic sample (N = 157) was 41.50 (range 19-76). The majority (59.2%, n = 93) were male, White (65.0%, n = 102), and 55.4% (n = 87) had a bachelor's degree education or higher. The majority (65.6%, n = 103) were married with 76.4% (n = 81) currently living with their spouse. In total, 80 (51.0%) had PTSD and 77 (49.0%) did not have PTSD. There were no differences between those with PTSD and those without PTSD on demographic characteristics, except that individuals with PTSD were younger than those without PTSD (38.84 vs. 44.34, t = 2.54, p = .012).  Comparing individuals with and without PTSD by Intraclass correlation coefficients The  Sleep duration In individuals with and without PTSD, each of the five weekdays (Monday to Friday) had shorter sleep duration  , Table , and Fig. ). Among individuals without PTSD, the estimated means of sleep duration were 5.61 for weekdays and 6.27 for weekends, β = − 0.66 [− 0.87, − 0.44], p < .001. Sleep quality In individuals without PTSD, there was no difference in sleep quality across the 7 days or between weekdays and weekends. In individuals with PTSD, sleep quality on Tuesday and Thursday was worse than Saturday, which was set as the reference (see Fig.  and Supplement 3). Pairwise comparisons with Tukey-Kramer adjustment showed that Saturday was different from Thursday, and Sunday was different from Tuesday and Thursday. By weekday versus weekend, the Least-squares estimated means of sleep quality in individuals with PTSD were 1.34 for weekdays and 1.49 for weekends, β = − 0.15 [− 0.25, − 0.04], p = .007 (see Table , Fig. , and Supplement 4a). Trouble falling asleep In individuals without PTSD, there was no difference in trouble falling asleep across the 7 days or between weekdays and weekends. In individuals with PTSD, more trouble falling asleep was reported on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday than Saturday, the reference (see Fig.  and Supplement 3). Pairwise comparisons with Tukey-Kramer adjustment showed that Sunday was different from Tuesday and Thursday. By weekday versus weekend, the Least-squares estimated means of trouble falling asleep in individuals with PTSD were 0.55 for weekdays and 0.48 for weekends, β = 0.07 [0.04, 0.11], p < .001 (see Table , Fig. , and Supplement 4b). Difficulty staying asleep In individuals with and without PTSD, there was no difference in difficulty staying asleep across the 7 days or between weekdays and weekends (see Table , Fig. , and Supplement 4c). Differences between individuals with and without PTSD There were significant differences by PTSD group in all four sleep characteristics after controlling for weekday versus weekend (similar results were found for the 7-day DOW) and demographic covariates (see Table ).  Interaction of PTSD group and DOW The interaction of PTSD group and DOW examined whether participants with and without PTSD statistically differed in each sleep characteristic across the 7 days or between weekdays versus weekends. The only significant   Discussion This study examined sleep characteristics (sleep duration, sleep quality, trouble falling asleep, and difficulty staying asleep) and their variation across the 7 days of the week and specifically for weekdays versus weekends in individuals with and without PTSD. Similar to others , we found that on average those with PTSD had shorter sleep duration, poorer quality of sleep, and greater trouble falling and staying asleep. Although only two of these characteristics (i.e., trouble falling and staying asleep) are noted in the DSM-5 diagnosis of PTSD, in fact all four sleep characteristics differ between those with PTSD and those without PTSD. Importantly, the pattern of change across the 7 days of the week and the change between weekdays and weekends are different for those with PTSD compared to those without PTSD for sleep quality and trouble falling asleep. Among those with PTSD, sleep duration, sleep quality, and trouble falling asleep differed across the 7 days of the week and showed differences between weekdays and weekends. In contrast, for those without PTSD, only sleep duration differed across the 7 days of the week and showed differences between weekdays and weekends. For difficulty staying asleep, neither group differed across the 7 days of the week nor weekdays versus weekends. Sleep duration varied across the 7 days of the week and specifically for weekdays versus weekends for both those with and without PTSD, which is consistent with previous studies . For healthy adults, the average sleep duration is 7-8 h per night and duration is approximately 30 min longer on weekends compared to weekdays . In our study, mean sleep duration was 5.34 h among those with PTSD and 5.90 h among those without PTSD, and both groups slept longer on weekends (approximately 32 min longer for those with PTSD and 40 min longer for those without PTSD). However, the average sleep duration of those with PTSD, even with more sleep on weekends, was never as high as the average weekday sleep duration of those without PTSD. Other studies have found that days in which sleep duration is much shorter or longer that an individual's average are associated with worse cognitive functioning . Habitual short sleep duration (e.g., < 5 h per night) and long sleep duration (e.g., > 9 h per night) are associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality . Others have found that variation in the pattern between weekdays and weekends may also be associated with depressive symptoms , although not increased mortality . Sleep quality varied across the 7 days of the week and was better on weekends than weekdays, but only among those with PTSD. Sleep quality is closely related to the other sleep characteristics . The specific weekday versus weekend difference among those with PTSD may therefore suggest that PTSD-related stressors (such as threat cues) may be more common during weekdays or, alternatively, protective factors such as social support may be more present on weekends. Further study of sleep quality and its relationship to threat cues and social support is needed to understand the differences in sleep quality among those with and without PTSD. Trouble falling asleep, like sleep quality, varied across the 7 days of the week and differed between weekdays and weekends, but only for those with PTSD. Falling asleep has been closely studied to identify behavioral and pharmacologic interventions to decrease sleep latency . However, little is known about the neurobiology of falling asleep. PTSD is associated with being hyperalert to cues of threat which may also interfere with falling asleep. Further study of the neurobiological and behavioral aspects of trouble falling asleep among those with PTSD may aid in identifying interventions for this sleep characteristic and improve our understanding of the neurobiology of PTSD. It is valuable to note, as above, that sleep quality and trouble falling asleep showed weekday-weekend variation only among those with PTSD. These sleep characteristics may therefore offer unique opportunities to understand PTSD as well as important targets for intervention. Weekday-weekend variation in sleep disturbances may be related to a number of factors expected to differ between those with and without PTSD including occupational stress, daily activities, social interactions, substance use, as well as fundamental neurobiological differences. Difficulty staying asleep, in contrast to the other three sleep characteristics, did not show variation across the 7 days of the week nor weekdays versus weekends in either group. However, those with PTSD reported significantly more frequent difficulty staying asleep (32% of nights versus 16% of nights among those without PTSD). Prior research has shown that difficulty staying asleep was the strongest predictor of next day's post traumatic stress symptoms . These data therefore suggest that better understanding the greater frequency of difficulty staying asleep, rather than its temporal pattern may aid in understanding its relationship to next day's post traumatic stress symptoms. Our findings suggest that clinical care might be improved by assessments of sleep patterns and disturbances across at least a week, including weekdays and weekends. This is consistent with other studies that found one or two nights of sleep measurement may not accurately represent an individual's habitual sleep pattern . Wide fluctuations in sleep characteristics among those with PTSD comprise a major challenge for clinicians, whose ministrations may be difficult to assess in light of such variations . Sleep diaries can be an important addition to sleep assessments as they provide night-to-night information about sleep characteristics, promote discussions about sleep-related behavior, and may aid in identifying temporal relationships between sleep disturbances and daily events, which may be critical for interventions for sleep and PTSD. We know little about the importance of timing of interventions for maximum efficacy of behavioral or pharmacologic interventions. For instance, a medication to reduce trouble falling asleep may appear more or less effective depending on the day of the week that treatment is initiated. The individual's sleep duration pattern may inform the choice of sleep medication and use of medication may not be necessary on nights when there is typically little trouble falling asleep. The current study has several limitations. The measures are self-report and therefore subject to recall errors. This limitation is partially mitigated by collection of the daily report of sleep characteristics within hours of awakening and use of well-validated self-assessment measures. Sleep quality was measured with one item and results may have been different with a more extensive measure of sleep quality. The prevalence of sleep problems may be biased due to missing data. In addition, our sample consisted of current and former Service members and our findings may not generalize to civilians. Lastly, the statistical power to detect a between-person predictor and especially a significant interaction involving between-group predictors is limited. Thus, the results of interaction analyses are considered exploratory and only informative. These results highlight the differences in sleep characteristics and their variation during the week between those with PTSD and without PTSD. Importantly, the pattern of sleep quality and trouble falling asleep specifically distinguishes those with PTSD from those without PTSD. Future studies should explore the mechanisms related to the patterns of sleep disturbance among those with PTSD and the factors associated with the substantial proportion of within-person variance in sleep disturbances. Further understanding of the neurobiology of sleep characteristics may aid in identifying the disruptions associated with PTSD and may help to identify potential targets for behavioral and pharmacologic interventions. Conclusions On average those with PTSD had shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality, and greater trouble falling and staying asleep. Importantly, the pattern of change across the 7 days of the week and between weekdays and weekends are different for those with PTSD compared to those without PTSD for sleep quality and trouble falling asleep. Our findings suggest that clinical care might be improved by assessments of sleep patterns and disturbances across at least a week, including weekdays and weekends. Future studies should explore the mechanisms related to the patterns of sleep disturbance among those with PTSD. "
8,8,Do daily mood fluctuations activate ruminative thoughts as a mental habit? Results from an ecological momentary assessment study,"It has been suggested that mental habits may underpin a heightened disposition to engage in rumination in response to negative mood. The aim of the current study was to assess the role of habit in the dynamic interplay between affect and ruminative thinking in the flow of daily life experiences. Using mobile ecological momentary assessment, 97 participants recorded affect and rumination ten times daily over six days, after completing measures of trait ruminative brooding and habitual characteristics of negative thinking (e.g. automaticity, lack of conscious awareness, intent and control). Momentary fluctuations in negative (increased) and positive (decreased) affect was prospectively associated with greater rumination-levels at the next sampling occasion. The degree to which affect triggered a subsequent ruminative response was moderated by habitual characteristics of negative thinking in a theoretically consistent way. Stronger temporal pairing of negative affect and rumination was also associated with greater emotional inertia but less carry-over of rumination from one moment to the next. Depression vulnerability may be in the form of rumination being habitually triggered in response to momentary fluctuations in affect, with deleterious effect on mood. The findings may have clinical implications, as targeting the habitual nature of rumination might help reduce depression vulnerability.","[""Depression"", ""Rumination"", ""Habit"", ""Ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1016/j.brat.2021.103832,
9,9,"Effort, avolition and motivational experience in schizophrenia: Analysis of behavioral and neuroimaging data with relationships to daily motivational experience","Recent research suggests that schizophrenia is associated with reduced effort allocation. We examined willingness to expend effort, neural correlates of effort allocation, and the relationship of effort to daily motivational experience in schizophrenia. We recruited 28 individuals with schizophrenia and 30 controls to perform an effort task during fMRI. Individuals with schizophrenia also completed an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol. Individuals with schizophrenia with high negative symptoms were less willing to expend effort for rewards. Daily EMA assessments of motivation were positively associated with effort allocation at a trendlevel. Individuals with schizophrenia and controls displayed similar increases in BOLD activation in frontal, cingulate, parietal, and insular regions during effort-based decision-making. However, negative symptoms were associated with reduced BOLD activation in bilateral ventral striatum. These results replicate previous reports of reduced effort allocation in schizophrenia patients with severe negative symptoms, and provide evidence for the role of ventral striatum in effort impairments.","[""affective neuroscience"", ""cognitive neuroscience"", ""decision making"", ""neuroimaging"", ""schizophrenia""]",10.1177/2167702620901558,
10,10,Ecological Momentary Assessment of the Relationship between Positive Outcome Expectancies and Gambling Behaviour,"Relapse prevention models suggest that positive outcome expectancies can constitute situa-tional determinants of relapse episodes that interact with other factors to determine the likelihoodof relapse. The primary aims were to examine reciprocal relationships between situational positivegambling outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour and moderators of these relationships. Anonline survey and a 28 day Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) were administered to 109past-month gamblers (84% with gambling problems). EMA measures included outcome expectan-cies (enjoyment/arousal, self-enhancement, money), self-efficacy, craving, negative emotional state,interpersonal conflict, social pressure, positive emotional state, financial pressures, and gamblingbehaviour (episodes, expenditure). Pre-EMA measures included problem gambling severity, motives,psychological distress, coping strategies, and outcome expectancies.  No reciprocal relationshipsbetween EMA outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour (episodes, expenditure) were iden-tified.  Moderations predicting gambling episodes revealed:  (1) cravings and problem gamblingexacerbated effects of enjoyment/arousal expectancies; (2) positive emotional state and positivereframing coping exacerbated effects of self-enhancement expectancies; and (3) instrumental socialsupport buffered effects of money expectancies. Positive outcome expectancies therefore constitutesituational determinants of gambling behaviour, but only when they interact with other factors. Allpre-EMA expectancies predicted problem gambling severity (OR = 1.61_3.25). Real-time interventionsaddressing gambling outcome expectancies tailored to vulnerable gamblers are required.

11,11,Emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli interacts with momentary negative affect to predict nonsuicidal self-injury urges,"The current study investigated whether impaired emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli is a risk factor for real-time nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) urges. Participants were 60 university students with a history of repetitive NSSI. At baseline, participants completed an emotional stop-signal task assessing response inhibition to self-harm stimuli. Participants subsequently completed an ecological momentary assessment protocol in which they reported negative affect, urgency, and NSSI urge intensity three times daily over a ten-day period. Impaired emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli did not evidence a main effect on the strength of momentary NSSI urges. However, emotional response inhibition to self-harm images interacted with momentary negative affect to predict the strength of real-time NSSI urges, after adjusting for emotional response inhibition to neutral images. Our findings suggest that emotional response inhibition deficits specifically to self-harm stimuli may pose vulnerability for increased NSSI urge intensity during real-time, state-level negative affect.","[""Nonsuicidal self-injury"", ""Inhibitory control"", ""Emotional stop-signal task"", ""Urgency"", ""Negative affect"", ""Ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1016/j.brat.2021.103865,
12,12,How adolescents' working memory abilities relate to their alcohol craving in real-life contexts depends on biological sex,"We sought to elucidate whether stress, peers, and in vivo (i.e., direct) alcohol cues elicit alcohol craving in daily life among adolescents and to test whether individual variation in working memory function and biological sex alters these associations. Methods: We leveraged ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine momentary associations between stress, peers, and direct alcohol cues with craving, assessed as ""urge to drink alcohol,"" among 86 male (51.2 %) and female (48.8 %) frequent drinkers (i.e., two or more drinking days per week). Participants were ages 14-24 years (M = 20.7 years, SD = 2.1). Participants completed EMA throughout the day for about one week prior to randomization to a treatment condition for an AUD clinical trial. Pre-registered, secondary analyses focused on craving for assessments when adolescents were not drinking, and assessments occurring after drinking on drinking days were removed. Working memory performance was assessed in the laboratory via the Memory for Words subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Cognitive Abilities. Results: Craving was heightened at more stressful moments and when adolescents were with their peers and in the presence of direct alcohol cues. Working memory function was not related to craving but altered the relation of momentary stress, peers, and cues with craving once biological sex-related differences were considered. Females generally had lower craving than males, but working memory function served to buffer against stressinduced craving for males. Conclusions: Higher working memory function buffered the in-the-moment relation of stress with alcohol craving for males but not females.","[""Stress"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Alcohol"", ""Adolescents"", ""Craving""]",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108642,
13,13,How Task-Unrelated and Freely Moving Thought Relate to Affect: Evidence for Dissociable Patterns in Everyday Life,"Much of our knowledge about the correlates of mind-wandering comes from assessing task-unrelated thought. Less is known about the correlates of freely moving thought, a dimension that assesses the degree to which thoughts arise and unfold with low levels of guidance or constraints. Task-unrelated thought is consistently associated with more negative affective valence compared with being on task; however, it is unclear whether freely moving thought shares the same relationship with affect. We conducted two ecological momentary assessment studies in the context of everyday life and found that the two dimensions have different affective correlates. In Study 1, task-unrelated thought was associated with less positive concurrent valence than being on-task. However, freely moving thought was associated with more positive concurrent valence and was predictive of more positive valence at a subsequent timepoint. Freely moving thought, but not task-unrelated thought, also positively predicted concurrent arousal. Computational sentiment analyses of participants' thought descriptions offered convergent evidence of differential relationships between the two thought dimensions and affect. Study 2 used different measurement scales to assess whether (a) the pattern of findings replicated and (b) if the effects were robust to changes in measurement. The main findings were replicated: task-unrelated thought was negatively associated with concurrent valence, whereas freely moving thought was positively associated with concurrent valence. However, freely moving thought did not predict subsequent valence and was not related to concurrent arousal. The most robust findings related to concurrent valence. Although mindwandering has acquired a relatively negative reputation to date, our findings suggest that there might be positive aspects that remain unexplored.","[""mind-wandering"", ""affect"", ""task-unrelated thought"", ""freely moving thought"", ""valence""]",10.1037/emo0000849,
14,14,Stress reactivity as a putative mechanismlinking childhood trauma with clinical outcomesin individuals at ultra-high-risk for psychosis:Findings from the EU-GEI High Risk Study,"Aims.Childhood trauma is associated with an elevated risk for psychosis, but the psycho-logical mechanisms involved remain largely unclear. This study aimed to investigate emo-tional and psychotic stress reactivity in daily life as a putative mechanism linkingchildhood trauma and clinical outcomes in individuals at ultra-high-risk (UHR) for psychosis.Methods.Experience sampling methodology was used to measure momentary stress, affectand psychotic experiences in the daily life ofN= 79 UHR individuals in the EU-GEI HighRisk Study. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was used to assess self-reported childhoodtrauma. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, 1- and 2-year follow-up.Results.The association of stress with positive (¦Â=_0.14,p= 0.010) and negative affect (¦Â=0.11,p= 0.020) was modified by transition status such that stress reactivity was greater in indi-viduals who transitioned to psychosis. Moreover, the association of stress with negative affect(¦Â= 0.06,p= 0.019) and psychotic experiences (¦Â= 0.05,p= 0.037) was greater in individualsexposed to highv. low levels of childhood trauma. We also found evidence that decreasedpositive affect in response to stress was associated with reduced functioning at 1-year fol-low-up (B= 6.29,p= 0.034). In addition, there was evidence that the association of childhoodtrauma with poor functional outcomes was mediated by stress reactivity (e.g. indirect effect:B=_2.13,p= 0.026), but no evidence that stress reactivity mediated the association betweenchildhood trauma and transition (e.g. indirect effect:B= 0.14,p= 0.506).Conclusions.Emotional and psychotic stress reactivity may be potential mechanisms linkingchildhood trauma with clinical outcomes in UHR individuals.","[""at-risk mental state"", ""childhood abuse"", ""transition"", ""stress sensitization"", ""ecologicalmomentary assessment"", ""EMA"", ""experience sampling method"", ""ESM""]",10.1017/S2045796021000251,
15,15,Impact of self-efficacy on daily intention to not smoke,"Background: To improve cessation interventions, it is necessary to understand the factors associated with daily motivation to not smoke. One hypothesized factor is self-efficacy; however, there has been a lack of evidence investigating self-efficacy as a dynamic construct. Methods: This study examined the influence of baseline and daily self-efficacy on setting daily abstinence plans in pre-quit smokers and successful plans. Participants (N = 76) completed measures of self-efficacy at baseline, and each evening during 28 days of ecological momentary assessment. Results: Baseline self-efficacy was not correlated with mean daily rating of self-efficacy or variance in ratings. GLMM found that participants who had higher baseline self-efficacy than others were more likely to set an abstinence plan while participants who had a higher rating of self-efficacy on the previous night than others were more likely to set a plan on any given morning. Participants were less likely to set an abstinence plan if they had smoked on the previous day but were more likely if they had set an abstinence plan on the previous day. Participants were less likely to have a successful plan not to smoke if they smoked on the previous day. Conclusions: The current data indicates that both baseline rating and day-to-day fluctuations in SE influence daily abstinence plan in pre-quit smokers. Future intervention research could examine the use of methods designed to increase and maintain a person's daily self-efficacy and how this can be leveraged to encourage these smokers to attempt long-term cessation.","[""Self-efficacy"", ""Smoking"", ""Ecological Momentary Assessment"", ""Abstinence""]",10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.106877,
16,16,"Insights from a laboratory and naturalistic investigation on stress, rumination and frontal brain functioning in MDD: An fNIRS study","Recent research has emphasized rumination as an important maintaining factor in various mental disorders. However, operationalization and therefore induction of rumination in experimental settings poses a major challenge in terms of ecological validity. As stress seems to play a key role in everyday situations eliciting rumination, we conducted two stress paradigms while assessing behavioral and neurophysiological measures.Aiming to replicate previous findings on induced rumination by means of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and comparing them to physiological (pain) stress, a clinical sample of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; n = 22) and healthy controls (HC; n = 23) was recruited. Cortical blood oxygenation was assessed during the stress paradigms using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Further, we used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of stress, rumination and mood to be able to correlate ruminative responses during induced stress and everyday rumination.Our results showed that social stress but not physiological stress induced depressive rumination in MDD but not in HC. Further, rumination reactivity in response to social stress but not to physiological stress was significantly associated with rumination reactivity in everyday life as assessed with EMA. With respect to cortical oxygenation, MDD subjects showed hypoactivity in the Cognitive Control Network during the TSST, which mediated the differences between MDD and HC in post-stress rumination.Our findings emphasize the role of negative social triggers in depressive rumination and validate the TSST as an induction method for depressive rumination. The results inform future developments in psychotherapeutic treatment for depressive rumination.","[""Rumination"", ""Trier Social Stress Test"", ""TSST"", ""Socially Evaluated Cold-Pressor Test"", ""SECPT"", ""functional near-infrared spectroscopy"", ""fNIRS"", ""Repetitive negative thought"", ""Major Depressive Disorder""]",10.1016/j.ynstr.2021.100344,
17,17,The theory of planned behaviour and sleep opportunity: An ecological momentary assessment,"Insufficient sleep is common among American adolescents , college students  adults (Liu et al.,   2016), which is highly significant due to sleep's robust associations with health outcomes . However, the source of the USA sleep deficit is not entirely understood. It is estimated that 10% of adults in the USA have a clinical sleep disorder (Ram et al., 2010), and 7.7% of college students have insomnia (Schlarb et al., 2012), demonstrating that many individuals may be choosing to restrict their sleep. Whereas sleep duration is influenced by a broad range of behavioural, environmental, and physiological factors (Irish et al., 2015; Klerman & Dijk, 2005), the amount of time allowed for sleep at night (i.e. sleep opportunity) is more directly within behavioural control, and therefore represents an important target for sleep health promotion efforts. It is not well understood why or how individuals make decisions about establishing healthy sleep opportunities. The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) offers an established theoretical framework to study sleep opportunity. The TPB has been used for decades to study why people participate, or do not",,10.1111/jsr.13420,

19,19,"Mental Health and Behavior of College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Mobile Smartphone and Ecological Momentary Assessment Study, Part II","Background: Since late 2019, the lives of people across the globe have been disrupted by COVID-19. Millions of people have become infected with the disease, while billions of people have been continually asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that it is associated with large-scale behavioral and mental health changes; however, few studies have been able to track these changes with frequent, near real-time sampling or compare these changes to previous years of data for the same individuals.Objective: By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data in a cohort of college-aged students enrolled in a longitudinal study, we seek to understand the behavioral and mental health impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, measured by interest across the United States in the search terms coronavirus and COVID fatigue.Methods: Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone use, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife mobile smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Spring 2020 term, as compared to previous terms in the same cohort, were modeled using mixed linear models.Results: Linear mixed models demonstrated differences in phone use, sleep, sedentary time and number of locations visited associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In further models, these behaviors were strongly associated with increased interest in COVID fatigue. When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, phone use, sedentary time), both anxiety and depression (P<.001) were significantly associated with interest in COVID fatigue. Notably, these behavioral and mental health changes are consistent with those observed around the initial implementation of COVID-19 lockdowns in the spring of 2020. Conclusions: In the initial lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, people spent more time on their phones, were moresedentary, visited fewer locations, and exhibited increased symptoms of anxiety and depression. As the pandemic persisted throughthe spring, people continued to exhibit very similar changes in both mental health and behaviors. Although these large-scale shiftsin mental health and behaviors are unsurprising, understanding them is critical in disrupting the negative consequences to mentalhealth during the ongoing pandemic.

20,20,mHealth-Assisted Detection of Precursors to Relapse in Schizophrenia,"Theoretical views and a growing body of empirical evidence suggest that psychiatric relapses in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSDs) have measurable warning signs. However, because they are time-and resource-intensive, existing assessment approaches are not well-suited to detect these warning signs in a timely, scalable fashion. Mobile technologies deploying frequent measurements-i.e., ecological momentary assessment-could be leveraged to detect increases in symptoms that may precede relapses. The present study examined EMA measurements with growth curve models in the 100 days preceding and following 27 relapses (among n = 20 individuals with SSDs) to identify (1) what symptoms changed in the periods gradually preceding, following, and right as relapses occur, (2) how large were these changes, and (3) on what time scale did they occur. Results demonstrated that, on average, participants reported elevations in negative mood (d = 0.34), anxiety (d =0.49), persecutory ideation (d =0.35), and hallucinations (d =0.34) on relapse days relative to their average during the study. These increases emerged gradually on average from significant and steady increases (d = 0.05 per week) in persecutory ideation and hallucinations over the 100-day period preceding relapse. This suggests that brief (i.e., 1-2 item) assessments of psychotic symptoms may detect meaningful signals that precede psychiatric relapses long before they occur. These assessments could increase opportunities for relapse prevention as remote measurement-based care management platforms develop.","[""technology"", ""mobile health"", ""schizophrenia"", ""relapse"", ""ecological momentary assessment""]",10.3389/fpsyt.2021.642200,

Emerging data indicate the importance of reward and anticipatory processes as maintenance mechanisms of bulimia nervosa that can be targeted in treatment. The proposed research will identify neurobiological and psychological anticipatory mechanisms of binge eating and purging using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in the natural environment. In this investigation, 60 adults (30 with bulimia nervosa and 30 matched comparison participants) will undergo negative and positive mood inductions followed by an fMRI food selection task (and a comparison shopping task) to examine neurobiological and affective responses to food and non-food reward anticipation. Participants with bulimia nervosa will complete two weeks of EMA examining realtime affect changes in relation to the anticipation of binge eating and purging. These methods will facilitate rigorous assessment of the links between neurobiological (fMRI) and naturalistic (EMA) data in anticipatory reward processes. Findings from this investigation will inform the conceptualization and treatment of bulimia nervosa by identifying the role of reward anticipation in symptom maintenance, providing a crucial framework for targeting these anticipatory processes in existing and novel interventions.","[""bulimia nervosa"", ""fMRI"", ""EMA""]",10.20900/jpbs.20210005,

23,23,Perseverative Cognition in the Positive Valence Systems: An Experimental and Ecological Investigation,"Perseverative cognition (PC) is a transdiagnostic risk factor that characterizes both hypo-motivational (e.g., depression) and hyper-motivational (e.g., addiction) disorders; however, it hasbeen almost exclusively studied within the context of the negative valence systems. The present studyaimed to fill this gap by combining laboratory-based, computational and ecological assessments.Healthy individuals performed the Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT) before and after the inductionof PC or a waiting period. Computational modeling was applied to dissociate the effects of PC onreward sensitivity and learning rate.  Afterwards, participants underwent a one-week ecologicalmomentary assessment of daily PC occurrence, as well as anticipatory and consummatory reward-related behavior. Induction of PC led to increased response bias on the PRT compared to waiting,likely due to an increase in learning rate but not in reward sensitivity, as suggested by computationalmodeling. In daily-life, PC increased the discrepancy between expected and obtained rewards (i.e.,prediction error).  Current converging experimental and ecological evidence suggests that PC isassociated with abnormalities in the functionality of positive valence systems. Given the role of PCin the prediction, maintenance, and recurrence of psychopathology, it would be clinically valuable toextend research on this topic beyond the negative valence systems.

24,24,"Predictors of unplanned drinking in daily life: The influence of context, impulsivity, and craving in those with emotion dysregulation","Objective: Unplanned drinking, or drinking that violates intentions, has been linked to significant alcohol-related consequences; however, little is known about what factors within individuals daily lives predict whether un-planned drinking occurs. This  study examines the  influence of daily-life impulsivity, alcohol craving, and interpersonal contexts on unplanned drinking. Method: Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data were collected from 32 moderate drinkers. Participants were prompted six times per day for up to 21 days. Each morning participants reported whether they planned to drink that day. Multilevel and GEE models predicted drinking behaviors on days without intent to drink from daily-life interpersonal contexts, and pre-drinking ratings of impulsivity and craving. Results: Spending time in a bar and spending relatively more time with other people on days with no intention to drink was associated with drinking. Individuals who experienced higher craving prior to drinking were relatively more likely to engage in unplanned drinking. When participants reported relatively greater difficulties with premeditation, they were more likely to subsequently report initiating an unplanned drinking episode. Results also suggest that individuals generally higher on negative urgency may be less likely to engage in unplanned drinking but drink more when they do. Conclusion: These results indicate the influence of daily-life contexts, craving, and impulsivity on unplanned drinking behavior. We highlight several possible avenues for intervention and prevention efforts including modifying social and interpersonal environments, screening for craving patterns, and targeting cognitive deficits in planning.","[""Alcohol"", ""Unplanned drinking"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Craving"", ""Contexts""]",10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.106901,
25,25,Quality versus quantity: Determining real-world social functioning deficits in schizophrenia,"Social dysfunction is a hallmark of schizophrenia that is associated with emotional disturbances. Researchers have employed ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to measure social and emotional functioning in people with schizophrenia. Yet, few studies have evaluated quality of real-world social interactions, and it is unclear how interactions impact emotional experiences in this population. Using novel EMA that passively collects audio data, we examined daily social behavior and emotion in schizophrenia (n = 38) and control (n = 36) groups. Contrary to hypotheses, both groups interacted with others at the same rate and exhibited similar levels of positive emotion. However, as expected, the schizophrenia group exhibited significantly less high-quality interactions and reported more negative emotion than controls. Social versus non-social context did not influence experienced emotion in either group. This is the first real-world study to passively assess quality of social interactions in schizophrenia. Although those with schizophrenia did not differ in their number of interactions, they were less likely to engage in substantive, personal conversations. Because high-quality interactions are linked with better social outcomes, this finding has important potential treatment implications. Future research should investigate quality of interactions across different types of social activities to gain a more nuanced understanding of social dysfunction in schizophrenia.","[""Schizophrenia"", ""Social functioning"", ""Emotion"", ""Ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113980,
26,26,"Racial Discrimination, Sedentary Time, and Physical Activity in African Americans: Quantitative Study Combining Ecological Momentary Assessment and Accelerometers","Background: A growing number of studies indicate that exposure to social stress, such as perceived racial discrimination, may contribute to poor health, health behaviors, and health disparities. Increased physical activity (PA) may buffer the impact of social stress resulting from racial discrimination. However, to date, data on the relationship between racial discrimination and PA have been mixed. Part of the reason is that the effect of perceived racial discrimination on PA has primarily been examined in cross-sectional studies that captured retrospective measures of perceived racial discrimination associated with individuals' current PA outcomes. The association between real-time perceived racial discrimination and PA among African Americans remains unclear.Objective: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship among demographic, anthropometric and clinical, and psychological factors with lifetime racial discrimination and examine the within-and between-person associations between daily real-time racial discrimination and PA outcomes (total energy expenditure, sedentary time, and moderate-to-vigorous PA patterns) measured by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and accelerometers in healthy African Americans.Methods: This pilot study used an intensive, observational, case-crossover design of African Americans (n=12) recruited from the community. After participants completed baseline surveys, they were asked to wear an accelerometer for 7 days to measure their PA levels. EMA was sent to participants 5 times per day for 7 days to assess daily real-time racial discrimination. Multilevel models were used to examine the within-and between-person associations of daily racial discrimination on PA.Results: More EMA-reported daily racial discrimination was associated with younger age (r=0.75; P=.02). Daily EMA-reported microaggression was associated with depressive symptoms (r=0.66; P=.05), past race-related events (r=0.82; P=.004), and lifetime discrimination (r=0.78; P=.01). In the within-person analyses, the day-level association of racial discrimination and sedentary time was significant (Î²=.30, SE 0.14; P=.03), indicating that on occasions when participants reported more racial discrimination than usual, more sedentary time was observed. Between-person associations of racial discrimination  SE 0.28; P=.29)   or microaggression  SE 0.36; P=.34)  with total energy expenditure were suggestive but inconclusive.Conclusions: Concurrent use of EMA and accelerometers is a feasible method to examine the relationship between racial discrimination and PA in real time. Examining daily processes at the within-person level has the potential to elucidate the mechanisms of which racial discrimination may have on health and health behaviors and to guide the development of personalized interventions for increasing PA in racial ethnic minorities. Future studies with a precision health approach, incorporating withinand between-person associations, are warranted to further elucidate the effects of racial discrimination and PA.","[""racial discrimination"", ""physical activity"", ""ecological momentary assessment"", ""African American"", ""pilot study"", ""mobile phone""]",10.2196/25687,
27,27,Real-Life Self-Control is Predicted by Parietal Activity During Preference Decision Making: A Brain Decoding Analysis,"Despite its relevance for health and education, the neurocognitive mechanism of real-life self-control is largely unknown. While recent research revealed a prominent role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the computation of an integrative value signal, the contribution and relevance of other brain regions for real-life self-control remains unclear. To investigate neural correlates of decisions in line with long-term consequences and to assess the potential of brain decoding methods for the individual prediction of real-life self-control, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging during preference decision making with ecological momentary assessment of daily self-control in a large community sample (N = 266). Decisions in line with long-term consequences were associated with increased activity in bilateral angular gyrus and precuneus, regions involved in different forms of perspective taking, such as imagining one's own future and the perspective of others. Applying multivariate pattern analysis to the same clusters revealed that individual patterns of activity predicted the probability of real-life self-control. Brain activations are discussed in relation to episodic future thinking and mentalizing as potential mechanisms mediating real-life self-control.","[""Self-control"", ""Value-based decision making"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Ecological validity"", ""Brain decoding""]",10.3758/s13415-021-00913-w,
28,28,Real-time associations between discrimination and anxious and depressed mood among sexual and gender minorities: The moderating effects of lifetime victimization and identity concealment,"Background: Sexual and gender minorities (SGM) experience higher rates of depression and anxiety, which are linked to higher rates of discrimination and victimization. SGM individuals may conceal their SGM identities to decrease discrimination and victimization exposure; however, these experiences still occur, and concealment itself is often associated with greater anxiety and depression. However, it remains unclear whether lifetime victimization and identity concealment moderate the effect of day-to-day discrimination, which we evaluated in the current study using ecological momentary assessment (EMA).Methods: Fifty SGM participants (Mage=21.82, SD=4.70; 84% White) completed baseline assessment (e.g., concealment and lifetime victimization) followed by EMA of daily discrimination and anxious and depressed mood for 14 days.Results: As hypothesized, daily discrimination predicted momentary increases in anxious and depressed mood, b = .34, p < .001. Notably, these effects were more pronounced among individuals who reported higher levels of identity concealment, b = .25, p < .001, and previous SGM-based victimization experiences (marginally), b = .18, p = .05. Main effects of cumulative lifetime victimization and identity concealment, measured at baseline, were associated with higher ratings of anxious and depressed mood over the two-week study.Discussion: While identity concealment may reduce exposure to discrimination and victimization, we found that concealment and prior victimization predict heightened reactivity to daily discrimination experiences. Additional research is needed to further explicate real-time effects of minority stress exposure, and to develop interventions that may mitigate risk among SGM individuals with prior victimization exposure and higher levels of identity concealment in particular.","[""LGBT"", ""minority stress"", ""depression"", ""anxiety"", ""ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1037/sgd0000371,
29,29,Savoring the present: The reciprocal influence between positive emotions and positive emotion regulation in everyday life,"A growing body of research has investigated the regulation of negative emotions in ecological settings, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying positive emotion regulation in everyday life. Although some evidence suggests that adopting positive strategies is beneficial for emotional well-being, the literature is inconsistent about the effects of positive emotions on subsequent regulatory processes. In the present study, we adopted a two-week ecological momentary assessment to explore the association between positive emotions and positive emotion regulation in daily life. According to our results, the less individuals felt positive emotions at one point, the more they tended to enhance their use of positive strategies from this time to the next, which in turn resulted in subsequent higher levels of positive emotions. This prototype of positive regulation can be seen as a highly adaptive mechanism that makes it possible to compensate for a lack of positive emotions by enhancing the deployment of positive strategies. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","[""Emotions"", ""Mental health and psychiatry"", ""Cognition"", ""Happiness"", ""Attention"", ""Cognitive psychology"", ""Ecology"", ""Undergraduates""]",10.1371/journal.pone.0251561,

After com-pletion of baseline procedures, participants subsequently participated in a 10-day ecological momentary assessment protocol in which self-critical and self-punishment cognitions were assessed in real time three times daily. Employing bivariate and multivariate frameworks, our results demonstrate that both trait and state levels of self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions robustly differentiate between young adults with and without a lifetime history of NSSI. The present results also confirm that the temporal instability of these cognitive states also meaningfully differentiate between groups, such that those who exhibit greater fluctuations in these cognitive states are more likely to have a history of NSSI. The current findings suggest that trait, state, and temporal instability of negative self-focused cognitions may be vulnerability factors for engagement in NSSI.","[""nonsuicidal self-injury"", ""self-criticism"", ""self-punishment"", ""ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1016/j.beth.2020.08.006,

Methods: Using ecological momentary assessments to capture moments of binge drinking, marijuana use, nicotine use, and prescription misuse in everyday life, this study explored the romantic relationship contexts (status, quality, partner presence) of substance use among young adults (aged 18-21) attending a university in the Midwestern U.S. Between 2017 and 2019, 296 participants, who had endorsed recent substance use at screening for a larger study on prescription misuse, completed four reports per day for approximately 28 days, resulting in over 23,000 reports for this investigation. Results: Relationship status, partner support, and partner presence in the moment were all associated with at least one type of substance use behavior. Generalized multilevel models indicated that partnered participants engaged in less marijuana use, nicotine use, and prescription misuse in daily life compared to single participants. Higher partner support predicted less binge drinking, yet also predicted higher nicotine use and prescription misuse. When with a romantic partner in daily life, partnered participants were more likely to engage in binge drinking and marijuana use, and less likely to misuse prescription drugs. Nicotine use was more likely when with a partner, but only if partner support was high.

In the current study, we exam-ined whether a history of prenatal loss is associated with a subsequent pregnancy with mater-nal psychological state using ecological momentary assessment (EMA)-based measures ofpregnancy-specific distress and mood in everyday life.Method.This study was conducted in a cohort ofN= 155 healthy pregnant women, of whichN= 40 had a history of prenatal loss. An EMA protocol was used in early and late pregnancyto collect repeated measures of maternal stress and mood, on average eight times per day overa consecutive 4-day period. The association between a history of prenatal loss and psycho-logical state was estimated using linear mixed models.Results.Compared to women who had not experienced a prior prenatal loss, women with ahistory of prenatal loss reported higher levels of pregnancy-specific distress in early as well aslate pregnancy and also were more nervous and tired. Furthermore, in the comparison grouppregnancy-specific distress decreased and mood improved from early to late pregnancy,whereas these changes across pregnancy were not evident in women in the prenatal loss group.Conclusion.Our findings suggest that prenatal loss in a prior pregnancy is associated with asubsequent pregnancy with significantly higher stress and impaired mood levels in everydaylife across gestation. These findings have important implications for designing EMA-based ambu-latory, personalized interventions to reduce stress during pregnancy in this high-risk group.

Parental stress is a risk factor for harsh or punitive parenting, and this association may be exacerbated by the use of alcohol. Objective: We examine whether parental stress is associated with use of punitive parenting, as well as whether this association is modified by drinking pattern. Participants & setting: We used advertisements and word-of-mouth to recruit 342 parents living in Central Ohio during the initial stay-at-home order for COVID-19. Methods: We used geographic ecological momentary assessment (gEMA) to measure parental stress and punitive parenting during three time periods (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.) over a period of fourteen days using an app downloaded to their cellular telephone. Participants also completed a longer baseline survey. We used nested multilevel ordinal regression models, where at-themoment assessments (Level 1) were nested within individuals (Level 2) to analyze data. Results: Higher levels of parental stress [OR = 1.149 (95 % CI = 1.123, 1.176)] and later time of day [OR = 1.255 (95 % CI = 1.146, 1.373)] were positively related to odds of punitive parenting. Drinking pattern was not significantly related to punitive parenting in models with demographic covariates. Parents who drank alcohol both monthly and weekly and had higher levels of stress had greater odds of punitive parenting than parents with high levels of stress who abstain from alcohol. Conclusions: Alcohol may be an accelerant in the use of punitive parenting for parents experiencing stress. As alcohol use increases during COVID-19, children may be at higher risk for punitive parenting.","[""Child maltreatment"", ""Alcohol use"", ""Stress"", ""COVID-19"", ""Survey research""]",10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105090,
35,35,The costs of over-control in anorexia nervosa: evidence from fMRI and ecological momentary assessment,"A growing body of evidence suggests that a high level of self-control may, despite its positive effects, influence cognitive processing in an unfavorable manner. However, the affective costs of self-control have only rarely been investigated. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder that is often characterized by excessive self-control. Here, we used fMRI to explore whether over-control in AN may have negative affective consequences. 36 predominantly adolescent female AN patients and 36 age-matched healthy controls (HC) viewed negative and neutral pictures during two separate fMRI sessions before and after 10 min of rest. We tested whether abnormally elevated neural activity during the initial presentation in a brain region broadly implicated in top-down control, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), could predict subsequent activation in limbic areas relevant to bottom-up affective processing. Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), we also tested for associations between the aforementioned neuroimaging markers and negative affective states in the two weeks following the experiment. fMRI data revealed that higher initial activation of the dlPFC in AN predicted increased amygdala reactivity during the second fMRI session, which in turn was related to increased self-reported tension during two weeks following the scan. These data suggest that overcontrol in AN patients may come at a cost including negative affective states on a short (minutes) as well as a longer time scale (days). This mechanism may significantly contribute to the persistence of AN.",,10.1038/s41398-021-01405-8,
36,36,The Error-Related Negativity Predicts Self-Control Failures in Daily Life,"Adaptive behavior critically depends on performance monitoring (PM), the ability to monitor action outcomes and the need to adapt behavior. PM-related brain activity has been linked to guiding decisions about whether action adaptation is warranted. The present study examined whether PM-related brain activity in a flanker task, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), was associated with adaptive behavior in daily life. Specifically, we were interested in the employment of self-control, operationalized as self-control failures (SCFs), and measured using ecological momentary assessment. Analyses were conducted using an adaptive elastic net regression to predict SCFs from EEG in a sample of 131 participants. The model was fit using within-subject averaged response-locked EEG activity at each electrode and time point within an epoch surrounding the response. We found that higher amplitudes of the error-related negativity (ERN) were related to fewer SCFs. This suggests that lower error-related activity may relate to lower recruitment of interventive self-control in daily life. Altered cognitive control processes, like PM, have been proposed as underlying mechanisms for various mental disorders. Understanding how alterations in PM relate to regulatory control might therefore aid in delineating how these alterations contribute to different psychopathologies.","[""performance monitoring"", ""ERN"", ""error processing"", ""EEG"", ""self-control"", ""ecological momentary assessment"", ""daily life""]",10.3389/fnhum.2020.614979,

Technology use was associated with an increase in sleep onset latency; with better emotional, social, cognitive, and physical health; and with worse behavioral health. This study offers support for technology use having some benefits and expands research on technology use to adolescents with an evening circadian preference.","[""Technology"", ""Sleep"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Actigraphy""]",10.1007/s10964-021-01429-9,
38,38,Understanding at-the-moment stress for parents during COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions,"In spring 2020, many states in the United States enacted stay-at-home orders to limit the spread of COVID-19 and lessen effects on hospitals and health care workers. This required parents to act in new roles without much support. Although studies have asked parents about stress before and during the pandemic, none have examined how stress may have fluctuated throughout the day and the characteristics related to those daily changes.Objective: Our study assesses how time-varying (e.g., presence of a focal child) and day-varying (e.g., weekend vs. weekday) factors were related to parents' level of stress. Methods: We use Ecological Momentary Assessment to examine stress three times a day (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p. m.) for 14 days. We include two different dates hypothesized to be related to parents' stress levels: (1) when Ohio announced schools would go virtual for the rest of the academic year and (2) when most retail businesses were allowed to re-open. Our sample of 332 individuals, recruited via Facebook, Craigslist, and word of mouth, completed 13,360 of these brief surveys during April-May 2020. Data were analyzed using generalized ordered logit models. Results: Parents report lower levels of stress when completing the 9 p.m. survey, but higher levels when they were at work, during weekdays (compared to weekends) or when they were with the focal child. COVID-19 milestone dates were not related to stress levels. Conclusions: Parents need some form of respite (e.g. child care, child-only activities) to reduce stress, especially during the week when parents are juggling their outside employment and their child(ren)'s schooling. Providing parents with skills and tools to identify and reduce stress, such as apps monitoring heart rate or providing deep breathing techniques, may be one way of helping parents cope with extremely stressful situations.","[""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Stress"", ""Parents"", ""COVID-19"", ""Generalized ordered logit models""]",10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114025,
39,39,Use of Ecological Momentary Assessment to Study Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior: a Systematic Review,"Purpose of Review Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a recently introduced approach to patient evaluation that consists of asking patients questions in real time and in their usual habitat. This method seeks to contribute to suicide prevention by providing psychiatrists with detailed information about suicidal thoughts and behavior, how these fluctuate over short periods of time, and the short-term risk factors presented by patients. We conducted a systematic review of published research using EMA to study suicidal thoughts and behavior. Recent Findings Several systematic reviews of EMA in mental health have been conducted to date, and the literature contains numerous theoretical papers and compilations on EMA and suicide phenomena. To date, however, no systematic reviews have explored the use of this tool to study suicidal thoughts and behavior. Summary We performed a systematic review of five databases (i.e., PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) to identify studies on EMA and suicidal thoughts and behavior. An initial search revealed 544 articles. Following the study selection process, 35 studies were included in the review. Almost three-quarters of the studies were published in the last 4 years. The studies reviewed concluded that EMA was generally feasible and well accepted. EMA findings correlated well with the results of a retrospective assessment, though tended to over-represent symptom severity. Our review points to important aspects of suicidal thoughts and behavior, such as its wide fluctuation over short periods of time. Negative affect and disturbed sleep, among others, emerged as short-term predictors of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Therefore, EMA is a potentially useful tool in clinical practice, although not without drawbacks, such as participant fatigue with questionnaires and ethical concerns.","[""Suicide"", ""Suicide attempt"", ""Suicidal ideation"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Mobile health""]",10.1007/s11920-021-01255-7,
