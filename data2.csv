0,0,Ecological momentary assessment of interpersonal theory of suicide constructs in people experiencing psychotic symptoms,"Background: People with psychotic disorders are at an increased risk of suicide, but there is little understanding of suicidal ideation (SI) in this population. The Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide posits that perceived burdensomeness (PB) and thwarted belonginess (TB) contribute to SI. To our knowledge there are no studies using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to assess these interpersonal risk factors in a sample of individuals with psychotic disorders. This study investigated the validity and variability of PB and TB, and whether SI, EMAmeasured psychotic symptoms, mood, and social context relate to PB and TB. Method: Ninety-six participants with a psychotic disorder, including mood disorders with psychosis completed inlab assessments of current SI, and then EMA surveys on a smartphone 3/day for 10 days, answering questions about burdensomeness, belongingness, symptoms (i.e., hearing voices, experiencing suspiciousness), mood (i.e., happy, sad), and social context. Results: Burdensomeness varied within-participants less than belongingness (t (95) = -3.74, p=< .001). Participants with SI had higher mean burdensomeness ratings (t (94) = -2.70, p < .01) and lower mean belongingness ratings (t (94) = 3.68, p < .001) than did participants without SI. Being with others, greater psychotic experiences, less happiness, and greater sadness related to greater burdensomeness. SI status, being alone, greater psychotic experiences, less happiness, and greater sadness related to less belongingness. Conclusions: This study examined the real-time influences of SI and psychotic symptoms on burdensomeness and belongingness. Hearing voices, suspiciousness, mood, and SI are related to interpersonal suicide-related risk factors. In this sample, social context had a differential effect on burdensomeness and belongingness.","[""Schizophrenia"", ""Schizoaffective disorder"", ""Bipolar disorder"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""EMA"", ""Suicide"", ""Psychosis""]",10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.06.022,dvdvdvd
1,1,The after-effects of momentary suicidal ideation: A preliminary examination of emotion intensity changes following suicidal thoughts,"Research using ecological momentary assessments has highlighted the importance of negative emotions as predictors of day-to-day suicidal thoughts. Yet only one study has examined the real-time consequences of these thoughts. This preliminary investigation examined changes in emotion intensity following suicidal thoughts. It also explored associations between these changes and endorsement of suicide functions as an escape and/or as a solution, examined both as momentary thoughts and intractable beliefs about suicide. Thirty-nine community participants endorsing suicidal ideation were followed for two-weeks and completed multiple daily surveys related to suicidal thoughts, functions of suicide, and emotion intensity. Participants reported heightened emotion intensity immediately following a suicidal thought across six emotions, with delayed reductions in stress and anxiety following ideation onset. When assessed in the moment, suicide as a solution to a problem predicted increases in hopelessness, sadness, stress and general negative affect immediately following a thought, while suicide as an escape predicted increases in anger immediately after a thought. When measured as intractable beliefs, only stronger belief in suicide as a solution to a problem predicted delayed reductions in stress following ideation. Increased intensity of negative emotions immediately following suicidal ideation suggests a potential vicious cycle of heightened emotion intensity and suicidality.","[""Suicidality"", ""Experience sampling"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Real-time assessment"", ""Negative reinforcement""]",10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114027,dvdvdvdv
2,2,Across-subjects multiple baseline trial of exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for severe irritability: a study protocol,"Introduction Irritability is defined as a tendency towards anger in response to frustration. Clinically, impairing irritability is a significant public health problem. There is a need for mechanism-based psychotherapies targeting severe irritability as it manifests in the context of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). This study protocol describes a randomised multiple baseline design testing the preliminary efficacy of a new treatment, exposurebased cognitive-behavioral therapy for severe irritability in youth, which also integrates components of parent management training. We will investigate associations of this intervention with primary clinical measures, as well as ecological momentary assessment measures. Methods and analysis Forty youth will be enrolled. Participants, aged 8-17 years, must present at least one of two core symptoms of DMDD: abnormal mood or increased reactivity to negative emotional stimuli, with severe impairment in one domain (home, school, peers) and moderate in another, or moderate impairment in at least two domains. Each participant is randomised to a 2-week, 4-week or 6-week baseline observation period, followed by 12 active treatment sessions. Clinical ratings are conducted at baseline, biweekly (clinician), weekly (parent/child) throughout treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month and 6-month follow-up (clinician). Clinician ratings on the Affective Reactivity Index and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale for DMDD are our primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures include parent and child reports of irritability. Post hoc additional symptom measures include clinician, parent and self-ratings of depression, anxiety and overall functional impairment. Prospective, digitally based event sampling of symptoms is acquired for a week pretreatment, mid-treatment and post-treatment. Based on our pathophysiological model of irritability implicating frustrative non-reward, aberrant threat processing and instrumental learning, we probe these three brain-based targets using functional MRI paradigms to assess target engagement.

3,3,An Ecological Momentary Assessment of College Women's Decisions to Use Protective Behavioral Strategies,"Protective behavioral strategies (PBS) have been associated with reduced risk for sexual assault victimization in college women. Sexual assault risk reduction programs have had limited success increasing PBS use, particularly among heavy drinkers, suggesting a need for additional research on the malleable predictors of PBS use. Whereas longitudinal studies show women's decisions to use PBS can be both planned and reactive, little is known about the decision-making processes that affect PBS use on drinking days, when sexual assault risk may be elevated. The current study used ecological momentary assessment to examine variability in the associations between decision-making and PBS use within and across drinking days in first-semester college women. Participants (56 female drinkers) completed a 14-day protocol with three daily measures of intentions and willingness to use PBS, and once-daily diaries of PBS use. Multilevel models examined between-day and within-day effects of intentions and willingness to use PBS with regards to sexual assault PBS (e.g., communicating sexual boundaries) and drinking PBS (e.g., limiting alcohol consumption), respectively. On days when sexual assault PBS willingness increased throughout the day, women tended  to  use  more  sexual  assault  PBS.  This  association  was  strongest  among  women  who  were  typically  less  willing  to  use  these  PBS.  Among  women who were the least willing to use drinking PBS, their drinking PBS use decreased  on  days  when  they  reported  increased  willingness  to  use  them.  Decisions  to  use  sexual  assault  and  drinking  PBS  on  drinking  days  were qualified by women¡¯s typical levels of willingness to use the different PBS.  This  suggests  the  need  for  a  multi-faceted  intervention  strategy  that  targets both typical and event-level risk. Individual-level alcohol and sexual assault risk reduction approaches could be enhanced with event-level PBS messaging and evaluation","[""ecological  momentary  assessment"",  ""protective  behavioral  strategies"",  ""sexual  assault risk"", ""alcohol consumption"", ""college women""]",10.1177/08862605211005143,
4,4,Attachment and Borderline Personality Disorder: Differential Effects on Situational Socio-Affective Processes,"Insecure attachment and borderline personality disorder (BPD) are defined by similar affective and interpersonal processes. Individuals diagnosed with BPD, however, represent only a subset of those described as insecurely attached, suggesting that attachment may hold broader relevance for socio-affective functioning. Based on a 21-day ecological momentary assessment protocol in a mixed clinical and community sample (N = 207) oversampled for BPD, we evaluate the discriminant validity of each construct as it influences daily interpersonal interactions. We find that insecure attachment is associated with elevated perceptions of interpersonal disaffiliation and maladaptive strategies for affect regulation, whereas enacted interpersonal hostility is more distinctive for BPD. In a series of sensitivity analyses, we further highlight potential caveats to these findings when studying both constructs concurrently. Together, our results suggest that both insecure attachment and BPD contribute to problematic affective and interpersonal processes, but that they do so at different stages of the unfolding social interaction, which has important implications for their maintenance and treatment.","[""Attachment"", ""Borderline personality disorder"", ""Ambulatory assessment"", ""Multilevel structural equation modeling"", ""Daily socio-affective processes""]",10.1007/s42761-020-00017-7,
5,5,Capturing emotion coherence in daily life: Using ambulatory physiology measures and ecological momentary assessments to examine within-person associations and individual differences,"While emotion coherence has long been theorized to be a core feature of emotion, to date, studies examining response coherence have been conducted in laboratory settings. The present study used a combined approach of ambulatory physiology measures and ecological momentary assessment conducted over a 4-week period to examine the extent to which emotional experience and physiology show coherence in daily life within-persons; and whether individual differences in response coherence are associated with between-person differences in well-being, negative emotionality, and gender. Results revealed that, on average, individuals exhibited coherence between subjective experience and physiology of emotion, but that there was substantial between-person variation in coherence in daily life. Exploratory analyses revealed no credible link between levels of response coherence and well-being, negative emotionality, or gender. Findings contribute to the literature by demonstrating a novel methodological approach to measuring coherence in daily life and supporting the generalizability of coherence to ecologically valid contexts.","[""Emotion coherence"", ""Emotion concordance"", ""Response coherence"", ""EMA"", ""Well-being""]",10.1016/j.biopsycho.2021.108074,
6,6,Characterizing nicotine exposure among a community sample of non-daily smokers in the United States,"Background: Over one-quarter of all smokers in the United States identify as non-daily smokers and this number is projected to rise. Unlike daily smokers who typically maintain consistent levels of nicotine exposure with regular smoking, non-daily smokers have variable patterns of smoking that likely result in high intraindividual variability in nicotine intake. The current study aimed to characterize the weekly intraindividual variability in cotinine and identify smoking-related predictors in nondaily smokers. Methods: An ecological momentary assessment of 60 non-daily smokers ages 24-57 years was conducted over a consecutive 7-day at-home protocol to log each smoking session, assessments of mood and social activity during smoking, and collection of daily saliva samples in a convenience sample from Pennsylvania, USA. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the effects of smoking characteristics on total cotinine exposure measured by pharmacokinetic area under the curve and the range, maximum, and minimum cotinine values during the week controlling for demographic variables. Results: The mean daily cotinine level was 119.2 ng/ml (SD = 168.9) with individual values that ranged from nondetectable to 949.6 ng/ml. Menthol predicted increased total cotinine levels (P < 0.05). Shorter time to the first cigarette of the day predicted significantly higher minimum (P < 0.05), maximum (P < 0.05), and total cotinine values (P < 0.05) after controlling for covariates. Negative emotions and social interactions with others were also significantly associated with higher cotinine metrics. There was no significant effect of the nicotine metabolite ratio.Conclusions: Our findings highlight the variability in nicotine exposure across days among non-daily smokers and point to the role of smoking context in nicotine exposure. The findings suggest the need to develop better assessment methods to determine health and dependence risk and personalized cessation interventions for this heterogeneous and growing group of smokers.","[""Non-daily smokers"", ""Nicotine exposure"", ""Nicotine dependence"", ""Cotinine"", ""Smoking behavior""]",10.1186/s12889-021-11052-9,
7,7,Daily variation in sleep characteristics in individuals with and without post traumatic stress disorder,"Background: Sleep disturbances are common in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, little is known about how daily variation in sleep characteristics is related to PTSD. This study examined the nightto-night and weekday versus weekend variation in sleep duration, sleep quality, trouble falling asleep, and difficulty staying asleep in individuals with and without PTSD.Methods: Participants (N = 157; 80 with PTSD, 77 without PTSD) completed daily self-reports of their nighttime sleep characteristics for 15 consecutive days. Linear mixed models were used to examine the associations between the 7 days of the week and weekday versus weekend variation in sleep characteristics and PTSD.Results: Individuals with PTSD reported shorter sleep duration, lower sleep quality, more trouble falling asleep, and more difficulty staying asleep than individuals without PTSD. The pattern of change across the week and between weekdays and weekends was different between those with and without PTSD for sleep quality and trouble falling asleep. Among those with PTSD, sleep duration, sleep quality, and trouble falling asleep differed across the 7 days of the week and showed differences between weekdays and weekends. For those without PTSD, only sleep duration differed across the 7 days of the week and showed differences between weekdays and weekends. Neither group showed 7 days of the week nor weekday versus weekend differences in difficulty staying asleep. Conclusions: On average those with PTSD had shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality, and greater trouble falling and staying asleep. In particular, the day of week variation in sleep quality and trouble falling asleep specifically distinguishes those with PTSD from those without PTSD. Our findings suggest that clinical care might be improved by assessments of sleep patterns and disturbances across at least a week, including weekdays and weekends. Future studies should explore the mechanisms related to the patterns of sleep disturbance among those with PTSD.","[""Sleep"", ""Symptom assessment"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Military personnel""]",10.1186/s12888-021-03282-3,
8,8,Do daily mood fluctuations activate ruminative thoughts as a mental habit? Results from an ecological momentary assessment study,"It has been suggested that mental habits may underpin a heightened disposition to engage in rumination in response to negative mood. The aim of the current study was to assess the role of habit in the dynamic interplay between affect and ruminative thinking in the flow of daily life experiences. Using mobile ecological momentary assessment, 97 participants recorded affect and rumination ten times daily over six days, after completing measures of trait ruminative brooding and habitual characteristics of negative thinking (e.g. automaticity, lack of conscious awareness, intent and control). Momentary fluctuations in negative (increased) and positive (decreased) affect was prospectively associated with greater rumination-levels at the next sampling occasion. The degree to which affect triggered a subsequent ruminative response was moderated by habitual characteristics of negative thinking in a theoretically consistent way. Stronger temporal pairing of negative affect and rumination was also associated with greater emotional inertia but less carry-over of rumination from one moment to the next. Depression vulnerability may be in the form of rumination being habitually triggered in response to momentary fluctuations in affect, with deleterious effect on mood. The findings may have clinical implications, as targeting the habitual nature of rumination might help reduce depression vulnerability.","[""Depression"", ""Rumination"", ""Habit"", ""Ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1016/j.brat.2021.103832,
9,9,"Effort, avolition and motivational experience in schizophrenia: Analysis of behavioral and neuroimaging data with relationships to daily motivational experience","Recent research suggests that schizophrenia is associated with reduced effort allocation. We examined willingness to expend effort, neural correlates of effort allocation, and the relationship of effort to daily motivational experience in schizophrenia. We recruited 28 individuals with schizophrenia and 30 controls to perform an effort task during fMRI. Individuals with schizophrenia also completed an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol. Individuals with schizophrenia with high negative symptoms were less willing to expend effort for rewards. Daily EMA assessments of motivation were positively associated with effort allocation at a trendlevel. Individuals with schizophrenia and controls displayed similar increases in BOLD activation in frontal, cingulate, parietal, and insular regions during effort-based decision-making. However, negative symptoms were associated with reduced BOLD activation in bilateral ventral striatum. These results replicate previous reports of reduced effort allocation in schizophrenia patients with severe negative symptoms, and provide evidence for the role of ventral striatum in effort impairments.","[""affective neuroscience"", ""cognitive neuroscience"", ""decision making"", ""neuroimaging"", ""schizophrenia""]",10.1177/2167702620901558,
10,10,Ecological Momentary Assessment of the Relationship between Positive Outcome Expectancies and Gambling Behaviour,"Relapse prevention models suggest that positive outcome expectancies can constitute situa-tional determinants of relapse episodes that interact with other factors to determine the likelihoodof relapse. The primary aims were to examine reciprocal relationships between situational positivegambling outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour and moderators of these relationships. Anonline survey and a 28 day Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) were administered to 109past-month gamblers (84% with gambling problems). EMA measures included outcome expectan-cies (enjoyment/arousal, self-enhancement, money), self-efficacy, craving, negative emotional state,interpersonal conflict, social pressure, positive emotional state, financial pressures, and gamblingbehaviour (episodes, expenditure). Pre-EMA measures included problem gambling severity, motives,psychological distress, coping strategies, and outcome expectancies.  No reciprocal relationshipsbetween EMA outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour (episodes, expenditure) were iden-tified.  Moderations predicting gambling episodes revealed:  (1) cravings and problem gamblingexacerbated effects of enjoyment/arousal expectancies; (2) positive emotional state and positivereframing coping exacerbated effects of self-enhancement expectancies; and (3) instrumental socialsupport buffered effects of money expectancies. Positive outcome expectancies therefore constitutesituational determinants of gambling behaviour, but only when they interact with other factors. Allpre-EMA expectancies predicted problem gambling severity (OR = 1.61_3.25). Real-time interventionsaddressing gambling outcome expectancies tailored to vulnerable gamblers are required.

11,11,Emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli interacts with momentary negative affect to predict nonsuicidal self-injury urges,"The current study investigated whether impaired emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli is a risk factor for real-time nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) urges. Participants were 60 university students with a history of repetitive NSSI. At baseline, participants completed an emotional stop-signal task assessing response inhibition to self-harm stimuli. Participants subsequently completed an ecological momentary assessment protocol in which they reported negative affect, urgency, and NSSI urge intensity three times daily over a ten-day period. Impaired emotional response inhibition to self-harm stimuli did not evidence a main effect on the strength of momentary NSSI urges. However, emotional response inhibition to self-harm images interacted with momentary negative affect to predict the strength of real-time NSSI urges, after adjusting for emotional response inhibition to neutral images. Our findings suggest that emotional response inhibition deficits specifically to self-harm stimuli may pose vulnerability for increased NSSI urge intensity during real-time, state-level negative affect.","[""Nonsuicidal self-injury"", ""Inhibitory control"", ""Emotional stop-signal task"", ""Urgency"", ""Negative affect"", ""Ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1016/j.brat.2021.103865,
12,12,How adolescents' working memory abilities relate to their alcohol craving in real-life contexts depends on biological sex,"We sought to elucidate whether stress, peers, and in vivo (i.e., direct) alcohol cues elicit alcohol craving in daily life among adolescents and to test whether individual variation in working memory function and biological sex alters these associations. Methods: We leveraged ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine momentary associations between stress, peers, and direct alcohol cues with craving, assessed as ""urge to drink alcohol,"" among 86 male (51.2 %) and female (48.8 %) frequent drinkers (i.e., two or more drinking days per week). Participants were ages 14-24 years (M = 20.7 years, SD = 2.1). Participants completed EMA throughout the day for about one week prior to randomization to a treatment condition for an AUD clinical trial. Pre-registered, secondary analyses focused on craving for assessments when adolescents were not drinking, and assessments occurring after drinking on drinking days were removed. Working memory performance was assessed in the laboratory via the Memory for Words subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Cognitive Abilities. Results: Craving was heightened at more stressful moments and when adolescents were with their peers and in the presence of direct alcohol cues. Working memory function was not related to craving but altered the relation of momentary stress, peers, and cues with craving once biological sex-related differences were considered. Females generally had lower craving than males, but working memory function served to buffer against stressinduced craving for males. Conclusions: Higher working memory function buffered the in-the-moment relation of stress with alcohol craving for males but not females.","[""Stress"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Alcohol"", ""Adolescents"", ""Craving""]",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108642,
13,13,How Task-Unrelated and Freely Moving Thought Relate to Affect: Evidence for Dissociable Patterns in Everyday Life,"Much of our knowledge about the correlates of mind-wandering comes from assessing task-unrelated thought. Less is known about the correlates of freely moving thought, a dimension that assesses the degree to which thoughts arise and unfold with low levels of guidance or constraints. Task-unrelated thought is consistently associated with more negative affective valence compared with being on task; however, it is unclear whether freely moving thought shares the same relationship with affect. We conducted two ecological momentary assessment studies in the context of everyday life and found that the two dimensions have different affective correlates. In Study 1, task-unrelated thought was associated with less positive concurrent valence than being on-task. However, freely moving thought was associated with more positive concurrent valence and was predictive of more positive valence at a subsequent timepoint. Freely moving thought, but not task-unrelated thought, also positively predicted concurrent arousal. Computational sentiment analyses of participants' thought descriptions offered convergent evidence of differential relationships between the two thought dimensions and affect. Study 2 used different measurement scales to assess whether (a) the pattern of findings replicated and (b) if the effects were robust to changes in measurement. The main findings were replicated: task-unrelated thought was negatively associated with concurrent valence, whereas freely moving thought was positively associated with concurrent valence. However, freely moving thought did not predict subsequent valence and was not related to concurrent arousal. The most robust findings related to concurrent valence. Although mindwandering has acquired a relatively negative reputation to date, our findings suggest that there might be positive aspects that remain unexplored.","[""mind-wandering"", ""affect"", ""task-unrelated thought"", ""freely moving thought"", ""valence""]",10.1037/emo0000849,

This study aimed to investigate emo-tional and psychotic stress reactivity in daily life as a putative mechanism linkingchildhood trauma and clinical outcomes in individuals at ultra-high-risk (UHR) for psychosis.Methods.Experience sampling methodology was used to measure momentary stress, affectand psychotic experiences in the daily life ofN= 79 UHR individuals in the EU-GEI HighRisk Study. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was used to assess self-reported childhoodtrauma. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, 1- and 2-year follow-up.Results.The association of stress with positive (¦Â=_0.14,p= 0.010) and negative affect (¦Â=0.11,p= 0.020) was modified by transition status such that stress reactivity was greater in indi-viduals who transitioned to psychosis. Moreover, the association of stress with negative affect(¦Â= 0.06,p= 0.019) and psychotic experiences (¦Â= 0.05,p= 0.037) was greater in individualsexposed to highv. low levels of childhood trauma. We also found evidence that decreasedpositive affect in response to stress was associated with reduced functioning at 1-year fol-low-up (B= 6.29,p= 0.034). In addition, there was evidence that the association of childhoodtrauma with poor functional outcomes was mediated by stress reactivity (e.g. indirect effect:B=_2.13,p= 0.026), but no evidence that stress reactivity mediated the association betweenchildhood trauma and transition (e.g. indirect effect:B= 0.14,p= 0.506).Conclusions.Emotional and psychotic stress reactivity may be potential mechanisms linkingchildhood trauma with clinical outcomes in UHR individuals.","[""at-risk mental state"", ""childhood abuse"", ""transition"", ""stress sensitization"", ""ecologicalmomentary assessment"", ""EMA"", ""experience sampling method"", ""ESM""]",10.1017/S2045796021000251,
15,15,Impact of self-efficacy on daily intention to not smoke,"Background: To improve cessation interventions, it is necessary to understand the factors associated with daily motivation to not smoke. One hypothesized factor is self-efficacy; however, there has been a lack of evidence investigating self-efficacy as a dynamic construct. Methods: This study examined the influence of baseline and daily self-efficacy on setting daily abstinence plans in pre-quit smokers and successful plans. Participants (N = 76) completed measures of self-efficacy at baseline, and each evening during 28 days of ecological momentary assessment. Results: Baseline self-efficacy was not correlated with mean daily rating of self-efficacy or variance in ratings. GLMM found that participants who had higher baseline self-efficacy than others were more likely to set an abstinence plan while participants who had a higher rating of self-efficacy on the previous night than others were more likely to set a plan on any given morning. Participants were less likely to set an abstinence plan if they had smoked on the previous day but were more likely if they had set an abstinence plan on the previous day. Participants were less likely to have a successful plan not to smoke if they smoked on the previous day. Conclusions: The current data indicates that both baseline rating and day-to-day fluctuations in SE influence daily abstinence plan in pre-quit smokers. Future intervention research could examine the use of methods designed to increase and maintain a person's daily self-efficacy and how this can be leveraged to encourage these smokers to attempt long-term cessation.","[""Self-efficacy"", ""Smoking"", ""Ecological Momentary Assessment"", ""Abstinence""]",10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.106877,
16,16,"Insights from a laboratory and naturalistic investigation on stress, rumination and frontal brain functioning in MDD: An fNIRS study","Recent research has emphasized rumination as an important maintaining factor in various mental disorders. However, operationalization and therefore induction of rumination in experimental settings poses a major challenge in terms of ecological validity. As stress seems to play a key role in everyday situations eliciting rumination, we conducted two stress paradigms while assessing behavioral and neurophysiological measures.Aiming to replicate previous findings on induced rumination by means of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and comparing them to physiological (pain) stress, a clinical sample of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; n = 22) and healthy controls (HC; n = 23) was recruited. Cortical blood oxygenation was assessed during the stress paradigms using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Further, we used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of stress, rumination and mood to be able to correlate ruminative responses during induced stress and everyday rumination.Our results showed that social stress but not physiological stress induced depressive rumination in MDD but not in HC. Further, rumination reactivity in response to social stress but not to physiological stress was significantly associated with rumination reactivity in everyday life as assessed with EMA. With respect to cortical oxygenation, MDD subjects showed hypoactivity in the Cognitive Control Network during the TSST, which mediated the differences between MDD and HC in post-stress rumination.Our findings emphasize the role of negative social triggers in depressive rumination and validate the TSST as an induction method for depressive rumination.

It is estimated that 10% of adults in the USA have a clinical sleep disorder (Ram et al., 2010), and 7.7% of college students have insomnia (Schlarb et al., 2012), demonstrating that many individuals may be choosing to restrict their sleep. Whereas sleep duration is influenced by a broad range of behavioural, environmental, and physiological factors (Irish et al., 2015; Klerman & Dijk, 2005), the amount of time allowed for sleep at night (i.e. sleep opportunity) is more directly within behavioural control, and therefore represents an important target for sleep health promotion efforts. It is not well understood why or how individuals make decisions about establishing healthy sleep opportunities.

19,19,"Mental Health and Behavior of College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Mobile Smartphone and Ecological Momentary Assessment Study, Part II","Background: Since late 2019, the lives of people across the globe have been disrupted by COVID-19. Millions of people have become infected with the disease, while billions of people have been continually asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that it is associated with large-scale behavioral and mental health changes; however, few studies have been able to track these changes with frequent, near real-time sampling or compare these changes to previous years of data for the same individuals.Objective: By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data in a cohort of college-aged students enrolled in a longitudinal study, we seek to understand the behavioral and mental health impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, measured by interest across the United States in the search terms coronavirus and COVID fatigue.Methods: Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone use, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife mobile smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Spring 2020 term, as compared to previous terms in the same cohort, were modeled using mixed linear models.Results: Linear mixed models demonstrated differences in phone use, sleep, sedentary time and number of locations visited associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In further models, these behaviors were strongly associated with increased interest in COVID fatigue. When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, phone use, sedentary time), both anxiety and depression (P<.001) were significantly associated with interest in COVID fatigue. Notably, these behavioral and mental health changes are consistent with those observed around the initial implementation of COVID-19 lockdowns in the spring of 2020. Conclusions: In the initial lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, people spent more time on their phones, were moresedentary, visited fewer locations, and exhibited increased symptoms of anxiety and depression. As the pandemic persisted throughthe spring, people continued to exhibit very similar changes in both mental health and behaviors. Although these large-scale shiftsin mental health and behaviors are unsurprising, understanding them is critical in disrupting the negative consequences to mentalhealth during the ongoing pandemic.

20,20,mHealth-Assisted Detection of Precursors to Relapse in Schizophrenia,"Theoretical views and a growing body of empirical evidence suggest that psychiatric relapses in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSDs) have measurable warning signs. However, because they are time-and resource-intensive, existing assessment approaches are not well-suited to detect these warning signs in a timely, scalable fashion. Mobile technologies deploying frequent measurements-i.e., ecological momentary assessment-could be leveraged to detect increases in symptoms that may precede relapses. The present study examined EMA measurements with growth curve models in the 100 days preceding and following 27 relapses (among n = 20 individuals with SSDs) to identify (1) what symptoms changed in the periods gradually preceding, following, and right as relapses occur, (2) how large were these changes, and (3) on what time scale did they occur. Results demonstrated that, on average, participants reported elevations in negative mood (d = 0.34), anxiety (d =0.49), persecutory ideation (d =0.35), and hallucinations (d =0.34) on relapse days relative to their average during the study. These increases emerged gradually on average from significant and steady increases (d = 0.05 per week) in persecutory ideation and hallucinations over the 100-day period preceding relapse. This suggests that brief (i.e., 1-2 item) assessments of psychotic symptoms may detect meaningful signals that precede psychiatric relapses long before they occur. These assessments could increase opportunities for relapse prevention as remote measurement-based care management platforms develop.","[""technology"", ""mobile health"", ""schizophrenia"", ""relapse"", ""ecological momentary assessment""]",10.3389/fpsyt.2021.642200,
21,21,Neurobiological and Psychological Maintenance Mechanisms Associated with Anticipatory Reward in Bulimia Nervosa,"The purpose of this investigation is to identify the anticipatory reward mechanisms that maintain binge eating and purging in bulimia nervosa. Emerging data indicate the importance of reward and anticipatory processes as maintenance mechanisms of bulimia nervosa that can be targeted in treatment. The proposed research will identify neurobiological and psychological anticipatory mechanisms of binge eating and purging using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in the natural environment. In this investigation, 60 adults (30 with bulimia nervosa and 30 matched comparison participants) will undergo negative and positive mood inductions followed by an fMRI food selection task (and a comparison shopping task) to examine neurobiological and affective responses to food and non-food reward anticipation. Participants with bulimia nervosa will complete two weeks of EMA examining realtime affect changes in relation to the anticipation of binge eating and purging. These methods will facilitate rigorous assessment of the links between neurobiological (fMRI) and naturalistic (EMA) data in anticipatory reward processes. Findings from this investigation will inform the conceptualization and treatment of bulimia nervosa by identifying the role of reward anticipation in symptom maintenance, providing a crucial framework for targeting these anticipatory processes in existing and novel interventions.","[""bulimia nervosa"", ""fMRI"", ""EMA""]",10.20900/jpbs.20210005,

In this study we explored the wish to die and other suicide risk factors using smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in patients with a history of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. Contrary to our expectations we found a decrease in the wish to die during lockdown. This is consistent with previous studies showing that suicide rates decrease during periods of social emergency.

23,23,Perseverative Cognition in the Positive Valence Systems: An Experimental and Ecological Investigation,"Perseverative cognition (PC) is a transdiagnostic risk factor that characterizes both hypo-motivational (e.g., depression) and hyper-motivational (e.g., addiction) disorders; however, it hasbeen almost exclusively studied within the context of the negative valence systems. The present studyaimed to fill this gap by combining laboratory-based, computational and ecological assessments.Healthy individuals performed the Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT) before and after the inductionof PC or a waiting period. Computational modeling was applied to dissociate the effects of PC onreward sensitivity and learning rate.  Afterwards, participants underwent a one-week ecologicalmomentary assessment of daily PC occurrence, as well as anticipatory and consummatory reward-related behavior. Induction of PC led to increased response bias on the PRT compared to waiting,likely due to an increase in learning rate but not in reward sensitivity, as suggested by computationalmodeling. In daily-life, PC increased the discrepancy between expected and obtained rewards (i.e.,prediction error).  Current converging experimental and ecological evidence suggests that PC isassociated with abnormalities in the functionality of positive valence systems. Given the role of PCin the prediction, maintenance, and recurrence of psychopathology, it would be clinically valuable toextend research on this topic beyond the negative valence systems.

24,24,"Predictors of unplanned drinking in daily life: The influence of context, impulsivity, and craving in those with emotion dysregulation","Objective: Unplanned drinking, or drinking that violates intentions, has been linked to significant alcohol-related consequences; however, little is known about what factors within individuals daily lives predict whether un-planned drinking occurs. This  study examines the  influence of daily-life impulsivity, alcohol craving, and interpersonal contexts on unplanned drinking. Method: Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data were collected from 32 moderate drinkers. Participants were prompted six times per day for up to 21 days. Each morning participants reported whether they planned to drink that day. Multilevel and GEE models predicted drinking behaviors on days without intent to drink from daily-life interpersonal contexts, and pre-drinking ratings of impulsivity and craving. Results: Spending time in a bar and spending relatively more time with other people on days with no intention to drink was associated with drinking. Individuals who experienced higher craving prior to drinking were relatively more likely to engage in unplanned drinking. When participants reported relatively greater difficulties with premeditation, they were more likely to subsequently report initiating an unplanned drinking episode. Results also suggest that individuals generally higher on negative urgency may be less likely to engage in unplanned drinking but drink more when they do. Conclusion: These results indicate the influence of daily-life contexts, craving, and impulsivity on unplanned drinking behavior. We highlight several possible avenues for intervention and prevention efforts including modifying social and interpersonal environments, screening for craving patterns, and targeting cognitive deficits in planning.","[""Alcohol"", ""Unplanned drinking"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Craving"", ""Contexts""]",10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.106901,
25,25,Quality versus quantity: Determining real-world social functioning deficits in schizophrenia,"Social dysfunction is a hallmark of schizophrenia that is associated with emotional disturbances. Researchers have employed ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to measure social and emotional functioning in people with schizophrenia. Yet, few studies have evaluated quality of real-world social interactions, and it is unclear how interactions impact emotional experiences in this population. Using novel EMA that passively collects audio data, we examined daily social behavior and emotion in schizophrenia (n = 38) and control (n = 36) groups. Contrary to hypotheses, both groups interacted with others at the same rate and exhibited similar levels of positive emotion. However, as expected, the schizophrenia group exhibited significantly less high-quality interactions and reported more negative emotion than controls. Social versus non-social context did not influence experienced emotion in either group. This is the first real-world study to passively assess quality of social interactions in schizophrenia. Although those with schizophrenia did not differ in their number of interactions, they were less likely to engage in substantive, personal conversations. Because high-quality interactions are linked with better social outcomes, this finding has important potential treatment implications. Future research should investigate quality of interactions across different types of social activities to gain a more nuanced understanding of social dysfunction in schizophrenia.","[""Schizophrenia"", ""Social functioning"", ""Emotion"", ""Ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113980,
26,26,"Racial Discrimination, Sedentary Time, and Physical Activity in African Americans: Quantitative Study Combining Ecological Momentary Assessment and Accelerometers","Background: A growing number of studies indicate that exposure to social stress, such as perceived racial discrimination, may contribute to poor health, health behaviors, and health disparities. Increased physical activity (PA) may buffer the impact of social stress resulting from racial discrimination. However, to date, data on the relationship between racial discrimination and PA have been mixed. Part of the reason is that the effect of perceived racial discrimination on PA has primarily been examined in cross-sectional studies that captured retrospective measures of perceived racial discrimination associated with individuals' current PA outcomes. The association between real-time perceived racial discrimination and PA among African Americans remains unclear.Objective: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship among demographic, anthropometric and clinical, and psychological factors with lifetime racial discrimination and examine the within-and between-person associations between daily real-time racial discrimination and PA outcomes (total energy expenditure, sedentary time, and moderate-to-vigorous PA patterns) measured by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and accelerometers in healthy African Americans.Methods: This pilot study used an intensive, observational, case-crossover design of African Americans (n=12) recruited from the community. After participants completed baseline surveys, they were asked to wear an accelerometer for 7 days to measure their PA levels. EMA was sent to participants 5 times per day for 7 days to assess daily real-time racial discrimination. Multilevel models were used to examine the within-and between-person associations of daily racial discrimination on PA.Results: More EMA-reported daily racial discrimination was associated with younger age (r=0.75; P=.02). Daily EMA-reported microaggression was associated with depressive symptoms (r=0.66; P=.05), past race-related events (r=0.82; P=.004), and lifetime discrimination (r=0.78; P=.01). In the within-person analyses, the day-level association of racial discrimination and sedentary time was significant (Î²=.30, SE 0.14; P=.03), indicating that on occasions when participants reported more racial discrimination than usual, more sedentary time was observed. Between-person associations of racial discrimination  SE 0.28; P=.29)   or microaggression  SE 0.36; P=.34)  with total energy expenditure were suggestive but inconclusive.Conclusions: Concurrent use of EMA and accelerometers is a feasible method to examine the relationship between racial discrimination and PA in real time. Examining daily processes at the within-person level has the potential to elucidate the mechanisms of which racial discrimination may have on health and health behaviors and to guide the development of personalized interventions for increasing PA in racial ethnic minorities. Future studies with a precision health approach, incorporating withinand between-person associations, are warranted to further elucidate the effects of racial discrimination and PA.","[""racial discrimination"", ""physical activity"", ""ecological momentary assessment"", ""African American"", ""pilot study"", ""mobile phone""]",10.2196/25687,
27,27,Real-Life Self-Control is Predicted by Parietal Activity During Preference Decision Making: A Brain Decoding Analysis,"Despite its relevance for health and education, the neurocognitive mechanism of real-life self-control is largely unknown. While recent research revealed a prominent role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the computation of an integrative value signal, the contribution and relevance of other brain regions for real-life self-control remains unclear. To investigate neural correlates of decisions in line with long-term consequences and to assess the potential of brain decoding methods for the individual prediction of real-life self-control, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging during preference decision making with ecological momentary assessment of daily self-control in a large community sample (N = 266). Decisions in line with long-term consequences were associated with increased activity in bilateral angular gyrus and precuneus, regions involved in different forms of perspective taking, such as imagining one's own future and the perspective of others. Applying multivariate pattern analysis to the same clusters revealed that individual patterns of activity predicted the probability of real-life self-control. Brain activations are discussed in relation to episodic future thinking and mentalizing as potential mechanisms mediating real-life self-control.","[""Self-control"", ""Value-based decision making"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Ecological validity"", ""Brain decoding""]",10.3758/s13415-021-00913-w,
28,28,Real-time associations between discrimination and anxious and depressed mood among sexual and gender minorities: The moderating effects of lifetime victimization and identity concealment,"Background: Sexual and gender minorities (SGM) experience higher rates of depression and anxiety, which are linked to higher rates of discrimination and victimization. SGM individuals may conceal their SGM identities to decrease discrimination and victimization exposure; however, these experiences still occur, and concealment itself is often associated with greater anxiety and depression. However, it remains unclear whether lifetime victimization and identity concealment moderate the effect of day-to-day discrimination, which we evaluated in the current study using ecological momentary assessment (EMA).Methods: Fifty SGM participants (Mage=21.82, SD=4.70; 84% White) completed baseline assessment (e.g., concealment and lifetime victimization) followed by EMA of daily discrimination and anxious and depressed mood for 14 days.Results: As hypothesized, daily discrimination predicted momentary increases in anxious and depressed mood, b = .34, p < .001. Notably, these effects were more pronounced among individuals who reported higher levels of identity concealment, b = .25, p < .001, and previous SGM-based victimization experiences (marginally), b = .18, p = .05. Main effects of cumulative lifetime victimization and identity concealment, measured at baseline, were associated with higher ratings of anxious and depressed mood over the two-week study.Discussion: While identity concealment may reduce exposure to discrimination and victimization, we found that concealment and prior victimization predict heightened reactivity to daily discrimination experiences. Additional research is needed to further explicate real-time effects of minority stress exposure, and to develop interventions that may mitigate risk among SGM individuals with prior victimization exposure and higher levels of identity concealment in particular.","[""LGBT"", ""minority stress"", ""depression"", ""anxiety"", ""ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1037/sgd0000371,
29,29,Savoring the present: The reciprocal influence between positive emotions and positive emotion regulation in everyday life,"A growing body of research has investigated the regulation of negative emotions in ecological settings, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying positive emotion regulation in everyday life. Although some evidence suggests that adopting positive strategies is beneficial for emotional well-being, the literature is inconsistent about the effects of positive emotions on subsequent regulatory processes. In the present study, we adopted a two-week ecological momentary assessment to explore the association between positive emotions and positive emotion regulation in daily life. According to our results, the less individuals felt positive emotions at one point, the more they tended to enhance their use of positive strategies from this time to the next, which in turn resulted in subsequent higher levels of positive emotions. This prototype of positive regulation can be seen as a highly adaptive mechanism that makes it possible to compensate for a lack of positive emotions by enhancing the deployment of positive strategies. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","[""Emotions"", ""Mental health and psychiatry"", ""Cognition"", ""Happiness"", ""Attention"", ""Cognitive psychology"", ""Ecology"", ""Undergraduates""]",10.1371/journal.pone.0251561,
30,30,Self-Critical and Self-Punishment Cognitions Differentiate Those With and Without a History of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury: An Ecological Momentary Assessment Study,"The aim of this study was to examine trait, state, and temporal instability measures of self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions to evaluate their respective roles in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Participants were university students with a history of NSSI (n = 64) and those with no history of NSSI (n = 59). At baseline, participants completed measures assessing history of NSSI behavior, as well as trait measures of self-criticism and self-punishment. After com-pletion of baseline procedures, participants subsequently participated in a 10-day ecological momentary assessment protocol in which self-critical and self-punishment cognitions were assessed in real time three times daily. Employing bivariate and multivariate frameworks, our results demonstrate that both trait and state levels of self-critical and selfpunishment cognitions robustly differentiate between young adults with and without a lifetime history of NSSI. The present results also confirm that the temporal instability of these cognitive states also meaningfully differentiate between groups, such that those who exhibit greater fluctuations in these cognitive states are more likely to have a history of NSSI. The current findings suggest that trait, state, and temporal instability of negative self-focused cognitions may be vulnerability factors for engagement in NSSI.","[""nonsuicidal self-injury"", ""self-criticism"", ""self-punishment"", ""ecological momentary assessment""]",10.1016/j.beth.2020.08.006,

Methods: Using ecological momentary assessments to capture moments of binge drinking, marijuana use, nicotine use, and prescription misuse in everyday life, this study explored the romantic relationship contexts (status, quality, partner presence) of substance use among young adults (aged 18-21) attending a university in the Midwestern U.S. Between 2017 and 2019, 296 participants, who had endorsed recent substance use at screening for a larger study on prescription misuse, completed four reports per day for approximately 28 days, resulting in over 23,000 reports for this investigation. Results: Relationship status, partner support, and partner presence in the moment were all associated with at least one type of substance use behavior. Generalized multilevel models indicated that partnered participants engaged in less marijuana use, nicotine use, and prescription misuse in daily life compared to single participants. Higher partner support predicted less binge drinking, yet also predicted higher nicotine use and prescription misuse. When with a romantic partner in daily life, partnered participants were more likely to engage in binge drinking and marijuana use, and less likely to misuse prescription drugs. Nicotine use was more likely when with a partner, but only if partner support was high. Conclusions: Findings highlight the intricate links between interpersonal contexts and substance behaviors and indicate supportive relationships are not universally protective against substance use among this population.","[""College students"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Health behaviors"", ""Relationship quality"", ""Romantic relationships"", ""Substance use"", ""United States"", ""Young adults""]",10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114021,
33,33,The association between history of prenatal loss and maternal psychological state in a subsequent pregnancy: an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study,"Background.Prenatal loss which occurs in approximately 20% of pregnancies representsa well-established risk factor for anxiety and affective disorders. In the current study, we exam-ined whether a history of prenatal loss is associated with a subsequent pregnancy with mater-nal psychological state using ecological momentary assessment (EMA)-based measures ofpregnancy-specific distress and mood in everyday life.Method.This study was conducted in a cohort ofN= 155 healthy pregnant women, of whichN= 40 had a history of prenatal loss. An EMA protocol was used in early and late pregnancyto collect repeated measures of maternal stress and mood, on average eight times per day overa consecutive 4-day period. The association between a history of prenatal loss and psycho-logical state was estimated using linear mixed models.Results.Compared to women who had not experienced a prior prenatal loss, women with ahistory of prenatal loss reported higher levels of pregnancy-specific distress in early as well aslate pregnancy and also were more nervous and tired. Furthermore, in the comparison grouppregnancy-specific distress decreased and mood improved from early to late pregnancy,whereas these changes across pregnancy were not evident in women in the prenatal loss group.Conclusion.Our findings suggest that prenatal loss in a prior pregnancy is associated with asubsequent pregnancy with significantly higher stress and impaired mood levels in everydaylife across gestation. These findings have important implications for designing EMA-based ambu-latory, personalized interventions to reduce stress during pregnancy in this high-risk group.

34,34,"Stress, alcohol use, and punitive parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Emerging research suggests that parents are experiencing heightened stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parental stress is a risk factor for harsh or punitive parenting, and this association may be exacerbated by the use of alcohol. Objective: We examine whether parental stress is associated with use of punitive parenting, as well as whether this association is modified by drinking pattern. Participants & setting: We used advertisements and word-of-mouth to recruit 342 parents living in Central Ohio during the initial stay-at-home order for COVID-19. Methods: We used geographic ecological momentary assessment (gEMA) to measure parental stress and punitive parenting during three time periods (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.) over a period of fourteen days using an app downloaded to their cellular telephone. Participants also completed a longer baseline survey. We used nested multilevel ordinal regression models, where at-themoment assessments (Level 1) were nested within individuals (Level 2) to analyze data. Results: Higher levels of parental stress [OR = 1.149 (95 % CI = 1.123, 1.176)] and later time of day [OR = 1.255 (95 % CI = 1.146, 1.373)] were positively related to odds of punitive parenting. Drinking pattern was not significantly related to punitive parenting in models with demographic covariates. Parents who drank alcohol both monthly and weekly and had higher levels of stress had greater odds of punitive parenting than parents with high levels of stress who abstain from alcohol. Conclusions: Alcohol may be an accelerant in the use of punitive parenting for parents experiencing stress. As alcohol use increases during COVID-19, children may be at higher risk for punitive parenting.","[""Child maltreatment"", ""Alcohol use"", ""Stress"", ""COVID-19"", ""Survey research""]",10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105090,
35,35,The costs of over-control in anorexia nervosa: evidence from fMRI and ecological momentary assessment,"A growing body of evidence suggests that a high level of self-control may, despite its positive effects, influence cognitive processing in an unfavorable manner. However, the affective costs of self-control have only rarely been investigated. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder that is often characterized by excessive self-control. Here, we used fMRI to explore whether over-control in AN may have negative affective consequences. 36 predominantly adolescent female AN patients and 36 age-matched healthy controls (HC) viewed negative and neutral pictures during two separate fMRI sessions before and after 10 min of rest. We tested whether abnormally elevated neural activity during the initial presentation in a brain region broadly implicated in top-down control, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), could predict subsequent activation in limbic areas relevant to bottom-up affective processing. Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), we also tested for associations between the aforementioned neuroimaging markers and negative affective states in the two weeks following the experiment. fMRI data revealed that higher initial activation of the dlPFC in AN predicted increased amygdala reactivity during the second fMRI session, which in turn was related to increased self-reported tension during two weeks following the scan. These data suggest that overcontrol in AN patients may come at a cost including negative affective states on a short (minutes) as well as a longer time scale (days). This mechanism may significantly contribute to the persistence of AN.",,10.1038/s41398-021-01405-8,
36,36,The Error-Related Negativity Predicts Self-Control Failures in Daily Life,"Adaptive behavior critically depends on performance monitoring (PM), the ability to monitor action outcomes and the need to adapt behavior. PM-related brain activity has been linked to guiding decisions about whether action adaptation is warranted. The present study examined whether PM-related brain activity in a flanker task, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), was associated with adaptive behavior in daily life. Specifically, we were interested in the employment of self-control, operationalized as self-control failures (SCFs), and measured using ecological momentary assessment. Analyses were conducted using an adaptive elastic net regression to predict SCFs from EEG in a sample of 131 participants. The model was fit using within-subject averaged response-locked EEG activity at each electrode and time point within an epoch surrounding the response. We found that higher amplitudes of the error-related negativity (ERN) were related to fewer SCFs. This suggests that lower error-related activity may relate to lower recruitment of interventive self-control in daily life. Altered cognitive control processes, like PM, have been proposed as underlying mechanisms for various mental disorders. Understanding how alterations in PM relate to regulatory control might therefore aid in delineating how these alterations contribute to different psychopathologies.","[""performance monitoring"", ""ERN"", ""error processing"", ""EEG"", ""self-control"", ""ecological momentary assessment"", ""daily life""]",10.3389/fnhum.2020.614979,

38,38,Understanding at-the-moment stress for parents during COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions,"In spring 2020, many states in the United States enacted stay-at-home orders to limit the spread of COVID-19 and lessen effects on hospitals and health care workers. This required parents to act in new roles without much support. Although studies have asked parents about stress before and during the pandemic, none have examined how stress may have fluctuated throughout the day and the characteristics related to those daily changes.Objective: Our study assesses how time-varying (e.g., presence of a focal child) and day-varying (e.g., weekend vs. weekday) factors were related to parents' level of stress. Methods: We use Ecological Momentary Assessment to examine stress three times a day (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p. m.) for 14 days. We include two different dates hypothesized to be related to parents' stress levels: (1) when Ohio announced schools would go virtual for the rest of the academic year and (2) when most retail businesses were allowed to re-open. Our sample of 332 individuals, recruited via Facebook, Craigslist, and word of mouth, completed 13,360 of these brief surveys during April-May 2020. Data were analyzed using generalized ordered logit models. Results: Parents report lower levels of stress when completing the 9 p.m. survey, but higher levels when they were at work, during weekdays (compared to weekends) or when they were with the focal child. COVID-19 milestone dates were not related to stress levels. Conclusions: Parents need some form of respite (e.g. child care, child-only activities) to reduce stress, especially during the week when parents are juggling their outside employment and their child(ren)'s schooling. Providing parents with skills and tools to identify and reduce stress, such as apps monitoring heart rate or providing deep breathing techniques, may be one way of helping parents cope with extremely stressful situations.","[""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Stress"", ""Parents"", ""COVID-19"", ""Generalized ordered logit models""]",10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114025,
39,39,Use of Ecological Momentary Assessment to Study Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior: a Systematic Review,"Purpose of Review Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a recently introduced approach to patient evaluation that consists of asking patients questions in real time and in their usual habitat. This method seeks to contribute to suicide prevention by providing psychiatrists with detailed information about suicidal thoughts and behavior, how these fluctuate over short periods of time, and the short-term risk factors presented by patients. We conducted a systematic review of published research using EMA to study suicidal thoughts and behavior. Recent Findings Several systematic reviews of EMA in mental health have been conducted to date, and the literature contains numerous theoretical papers and compilations on EMA and suicide phenomena. To date, however, no systematic reviews have explored the use of this tool to study suicidal thoughts and behavior. Summary We performed a systematic review of five databases (i.e., PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) to identify studies on EMA and suicidal thoughts and behavior. An initial search revealed 544 articles. Following the study selection process, 35 studies were included in the review. Almost three-quarters of the studies were published in the last 4 years. The studies reviewed concluded that EMA was generally feasible and well accepted. EMA findings correlated well with the results of a retrospective assessment, though tended to over-represent symptom severity. Our review points to important aspects of suicidal thoughts and behavior, such as its wide fluctuation over short periods of time. Negative affect and disturbed sleep, among others, emerged as short-term predictors of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Therefore, EMA is a potentially useful tool in clinical practice, although not without drawbacks, such as participant fatigue with questionnaires and ethical concerns.","[""Suicide"", ""Suicide attempt"", ""Suicidal ideation"", ""Ecological momentary assessment"", ""Mobile health""]",10.1007/s11920-021-01255-7,
