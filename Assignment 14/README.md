# Sprint 7 SSO Project
This project is currently live at: https://cs-heidelberg-staging.herokuapp.com/home.   
There are also some screenshots of the website above.   

It is worked together with the cs4380 database final project. The website is about the restaurant Heidelberg which is near the campus.   
In the website, you can register and then login. After you register, your account's information will be stored in firebase. After you successfully login, you can access the data in database and use the functions.  
(Or you can use Email:Hi@g.com Password:123456 to login.)

To run the code using localhost, you need to download all the files and use npm install.  
cd Assignment\ 14  
cd Frontend   
ng serve   

And then open another terminal:    
cd Assignment\ 14   
nodemon server.js   

And then use http://localhost:4200/ to access the website.
