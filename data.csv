0,0,Across-subjects multiple baseline trial of exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for severe irritability: a study protocol,"INTRODUCTION Irritability is defined as a tendency towards anger and outbursts.  Clinically, impairing irritability is a significant public health problem,  and is among the most frequent presenting problems in youth psychiatric practice.  Longitudinally, irritability predicts depression, anxiety,  suicidality,  and is associated with functional impairment.  The need to diagnose address and treat youth with severe impairing irritability led to the inclusion of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th Strengths and limitations of this study ► This study protocol presents and tests a novel intervention to target core symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) symptoms (irritable mood, temper outbursts). ► This study protocol is employing parent management training (PMT) and principles of extinction derived from exposure therapy to target key mechanism of aberrant reward and threat processing, two core pathophysiologically informed dysfunctions posited in DMDD. ► The current protocol leverages state-of-the-art measures by collecting intensive, week-by-week clinical symptom data from patients, parents and trained clinicians, as well as behavioral and neural data from patients during the treatment. ► Despite the strengths and innovative aspects of the current study, the current multibaseline design is not a randomised controlled trial, therefore, it does not allow for strong causal inferences. ► The combination of both PMT and exposure techniques in the current treatment does not allow for separation of their effects. Open access edition (DSM-5). While this decision was somewhat controversial,  DMDD codifies clinically-significant temper outbursts and irritable mood. However, there is a need for additional evidence-based psychotherapies that specifically target the temper outbursts and irritable mood, the two core symptoms articulated in DMDD.  Coupled with this need, in recent years, there has been a movement towards treatment innovation based on engaging brain-behaviour targets that are hypothesised as translational mechanisms.  In this study, we test both clinical efficacy and target engagement of a cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) for severe irritability as it presents in DMDD. Only one prior treatment study targeting anger leverages pathophysiology to guide the treatment intervention.  Thus, additional mechanism-based, targeted interventions for DMDD are needed.  Biomarkers have transformed modern medicine but remain largely elusive in psychiatry. To date, treatments have either been serendipitous and/or developed primarily to address specific clinical symptoms. Augmenting this mechanism-driven approach, researchers    have suggested that experimental therapeutics should engage pathophysiological targets, while synergistically leveraging prior symptom-based theoretical approaches. Thus, here, we integrate and test mechanism-based approaches to target two core deficits in impairing irritability  : (1) aberrant reward processing and (2) aberrant threat processing. The inclusion of therapeutic techniques to target key mechanisms of irritability is intended to lead to more efficient, generalized and long-term outcomes.  Prior relevant treatments Some empirically supported interventions target irritability and disruptive behaviour as seen in disruptive behaviour disorders (DBD): attention-deficit\hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder. However, there are two opportunities to further build on this research. First, few existing interventions specifically target severe, impairing irritability and temper outbusts as present in the context of DMDD, which is a mood disorder as opposed to DBD.    Second, while there are a few categories of existing relevant empirically supported interventions: parent management training (PMT) and CBT for DBD, and dialectical behaviour therapy for preadolescent children (DBT-C) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) for DMDD, such treatments do not emphasise exposure techniques as a primary target. Meta-analytical evidence supports the efficacy of PMT in decreasing externalising behaviours, aggression, oppositionality and impulsivity characteristic of DBDs,  with a medium effect size for trials using blinded assessments.    For example, Parent-Child Interaction Therapy    is a manualized parent training intervention that has received substantial empirical support in the treatment of disruptive behaviour. Other interventions, such as the Incredible Years,  Stop now and Plan 36 and Kazdin's PMT,  are also evidence-based psychotherapies for externalising problems. However, most are targeted towards very young children  or target a broad spectrum of externalising problems.  Although some of these protocols include treating anger and aggressive outbursts  there is no protocol modified specifically to parents of youth with DMDD, potentially limiting the generalizability across symptom domains. Furthermore, studies of youth with ODD and ADHD have yet to systematically examine the effects of PMT on emotional symptoms, notably the irritable dimension.  PMT efficacy studies are needed to investigate the unique clinical and pathophysiological features of severe irritability in children and adolescents.  Early research suggests that youth with severe mood dysregulation show deficits during probabilistic response reversal and reversing previously rewarded associations.  It remains unknown whether PMT addresses such deficits in reward learning. CBT, which targets relationships among thoughts, behaviours and feelings,  has also shown efficacy in treating anger and disruptive behaviour.    Sukhodolsky et al  developed a CBT protocol for aggression using three modules: emotion regulation, social problemsolving and the social skills training aimed to prevent and resolve conflict situations. The first module starts with identifying anger triggers, developing prevention strategies and learning emotion regulation skills, such as cognitive reappraisal and relaxation training. The second module focuses on problem-solving skills, such as generating multiple solutions and considering different consequences and actions when dealing with conflicts. The final module focuses on developing skills for preventing or resolving potentially anger-provoking situations in different domains. In a meta-analysis of CBT for anger in youth, Sukhodolsky et al  reported a medium mean effect size across parent, teacher, observer and self-reports for physical aggression and/or delinquency in boys. Other meta-analyses and review papers examined the effect of evidence-based CBT/psychosocial treatments for disruptive behaviour or externalising disorders, showing mixed results for efficacy  ; however, the participants in those studies were not specifically referred for severe, impairing irritability. Although promising, such anger-based CBT protocols emphasise cognitive techniques (eg, generation of multiple solutions and the consideration of consequences for different courses of action in conflicts), rather than behavioral interventions. Several behavioral principles, such as exposure, might be explored in clinically irritable youth. Exposure techniques help patients to systematically approach aversive situations while resisting urges to avoid or escape. Such techniques teach patients to approach and tolerate triggering stimuli, despite their feared outcomes, using a graded hierarchy of exposure stimuli.    A recent promising clinical case report using the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children (UP-C)  demonstates a positive outcome in the treatment of a child with anger Open access and irritability.  UP-C, an emotion-focused transdiagnostic treatment for anger, consists of cognitive-behavioral techniques, encouraging patients to experience thoughts more mindfullly and neutrally. In a recent pilot study,  Hawks et al adapted the UP-C for the treatment of paediatric irritability in a sample of 19 children (ages  with primary presenting concerns of irritability and/or disruptive behaviours. Results supported the feasibility and acceptability of this treatment and provided preliminary evidence that such an approach may yield improved outcomes for symptoms of paediatric irritability and disruptive behaviours. Another recently published study by Evans et al  examined the effectiveness of a modular, transdiagnostic, behavioral/cognitive-behavioral intervention (MATCH), which is an existing flexible manual, for treating youth with severe irritability, compared with standard manualized treatments and usual care. Irritability was not specifically targeted in this larger study. MATCH showed the most consistent improvement in reducing irritability across multiple measurement schedules and informants. Taken together, the development and examination of expanded behavioral (eg, exposurebased) interventions targeting irritability requires further research, towards the goal of identifying active components effective in reducing irritability in youth with DMDD. In a complementary line of work, Perepletchikova et al  adapted DBT for preadolescent children (DBT-C), drawing from DBT  and its adolescent adaptation (DBT-A).  DBT-C provides youth and parents with skills training, coaching and therapy aimed to help families apply and generalize skills in mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, validation and behaviourism/reinforcement principles. An initial DBT-C randomised controlled trial (RCT) in a sample of youth with DMDD demonstrated efficacy.  At post-treatment assessment, following 32 weeks of DBT training, children reported a significant increase in adaptive coping skills and significant decreases in depressive symptoms and problematic internalising behaviours.  In additional work examining irritability in the context of mood disorders, a recent pilot RCT  assessed the feasibilty and preliminary efficacy of an adapted version of IPT for mood and behaviour dysregulation in youth with DMDD. Results indicated decreased outbursts and irritability and improved interpersonal interacting after treatment. In sum, paediatric adaptations of DBT and IPT show positive preliminary results in youth with DMDD. Collectively, accumulating evidence supports the efficacy of different treatment components of PMT, CBT, DBT and IPT in treating externalising behaviours, aggression, oppositionality, impulsivity and irritability across various diagnoses. This novel protocol intervention builds on prior treatments. First, the current protocol specifically targets youth's encoding of nonreward and threat stimuli in the context of frustration, and integrates approaches of CBT and PMT. Second, the current protocol emphasises in vivo behavioral exposure to anger-inducing stimuli, independent of skills training in the additional domains of distress tolerance, mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness and validation strategies. The current study The current protocol relies on a pathophysiological framework with the aim to implement CBT and PMT techniques to adress pathophysiological targets. Specifically, the intervention is capitalising on empirically supported and theory-driven interventions and posits two core mechanisms of impairing irritability: (1) exposure-based CBT to target exaggerated responses to frustrative nonreward and/or threatening stimuli and (2) PMT to target aberrant reward processing; with both mechanisms being mediated by abnormalities in frontoamygdalar circuitry. Some studies show that high irritability is associated with decreased activation in regulatory prefrontal regions during frustration,  and that these regions have a critical role in emotion processing by regulating activity of the amygdala.  Of note, regulation of amygdala activity by the prefrontal cortex seems to be one of the key mechanisms underlying exposure techniques.  Some evidence suggests that exposure might not be successful in treating proactive aggression  (representing predatory attacks motivated by external reward). However, irritability is characterised by reactive aggression,  meaning affectively driven aggressive responses to others' behaviour that is perceived as threatening or intentional. Here, we extend prior work by investigating CBT for chronic, severe and impairing irritability and temper outbursts. This CBT uses both in-session and betweensession in vivo exposures to anger-inducing stimuli as the primary behavioral technique. Previous evidence suggests that effective behavioral interventions targeting the threat system may also be applied to the treatment of anger-based disorders. Therefore, this protocol examines whether exposure to stimuli that evoke frustration and anger effectively reduces irritability. Similar to exposure therapy for anxiety and fear disorders, we conceptualise that exposure therapy will help severely irritable youth to increase their anger tolerance (without engaging in aggressive behaviours), decreasing manifestations of irritability, temper outburts and irritable mood. A novel aspect of the exposure work in the current study involves patient and therapist creating an anger hierarchy associated with different anger-inducing triggers for the patient. During therapy sessions, the therapist explicitly tries to evoke anger, before challenging the child to tolerate circumstances and demands, or to shape the environment to not acquiesce/reinforce. Our PMT intervention relies on the assumption that whether a child's difficulties in reward processing manifest through irritable behaviour is also dependent on the parental behaviours and parental contingency management. Hence, the current protocol consists of a modified PMT, including elements such as active ignoring and positive praise.  The incorporation of these PMT strategies aims to counteract deficits in frustrative non-reward Open access response and, in turn, improve the child's symptoms and distress.  An open pilot trial of exposure-based CBT procedures for DMDD demonstrated initial feasibility.  Preliminary results indicated a pre-treatment to post-treatment reduction in DMDD symptom severity, as measured by the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity and Improvement (CGI-S, CGI-I)  scale and the Clinician-Rated Affective Reactivity Index (CL-ARI).  This CL-ARI is a paediatric, semistructured interview assessing temper outbursts and irritable mood. In the open trial, independent raters were not blind to treatment status. The current protocol addresses this limitation, in which clinicians' expectations may bias results, by using a randomised, multiple baseline design that staggers treatment onset across individuals.  Multiple baseline study designs are commonly used in cases where the dependent variable is not expected to return to baseline after the treatment had been applied. This design has a few strengths including increased confidence that changes in outcomes are a result of the intervention, if those outcomes occur across cohorts. To this end, we designed a protocol focusing on 12 weeks of exposure-based CBT plus PMT. The first half of each session (30-45 min) involves the patient completing exposure exercises. Throughout the therapy, the work with the child focuses on exposure, generation of an anger hierarchy, and gradual in-session exposure, and includes motivational interviewing to address ambivalence regarding change. Sessions with parents (30-45 min) comprise psychoeducation on reward learning and parental contingency management; parents are coached to praise and acknowledge their child's adaptive behaviours, and to actively ignore maladaptive behaviours. Other PMT elements include giving commands, setting limits, increasing time spent on positive joint activities, and delivering intermittent rewards. In later sessions, the therapist works with the parents on how to tolerate their emotional distress in response to their child's irritability symptoms. In between sessions, child is practicing tolerating their own anger through exposure while the parents are asked to employ techniques and strategies they had learnt in sessions (See table 1A,B) and for more details). We expect, that over the course of the treatment, using exposure and PMT techniques, patients will have an increased ability to tolerate their own anger and frustration, and an increased ability to regulate their feelings and behaviours in the context of frustrative non-reward or threatening triggers manifested through a decrease in irritable mood and temper outbursts. Overall, we hypothesise that the treatment will lead to decreased irritability (decreased irritable mood and temper outbursts) in response to frustration and to an overall decrease in illness severity. Given the importance of examining target engagement in treatment studies,  we probe the hypothesised neural targets throughout the treatment based on our pathophysiological model of irritability.  Specifically, participants complete resting state and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging Open access (fMRI) scans at different time points. Three fMRI paradigms assessing frustration, attention to threat and reward learning, separately, are included.  These paradigms test two hypotheses. First, we hypothesise that pre-treatment patterns of neural task activation will differentiate responders and non-responders (i.e., predictors or moderators). In an exploratory manner, we examine if activation and behavioral dysfunction across tasks can be used to determine who is most likely to benefit from treatment. Second, we predict that clinical improvement from pre-treatment to post-treatment will be mediated by prefrontal, striatal and amygdala circuit changes (i.e., mediation).   METHODS AND ANALYSIS The current study investigates exposure-based CBT and PMT for chronic, severe irritability and temper outbursts as they present in DMDD. Procedures Informed consent and assent are obtained from parents and youth, respectively, after complete description of study procedures and prior to study procedures. All participants are advised that research is voluntary and that they may withdraw participation at any time. Participants and parents complete a pre-treatment clinical evaluation onsite before being enrolled in the protocol. A trained and licensed masters-level or doctoral-level clinician conducts interviews with the participants and parents. We screen participants and follow them for several months prior to randomisation; any medication changes must be made prior to randomisation. We communicate to the family and the community treatment provider that once the child is randomised, the regimen cannot be changed unless there is an acute clinical need. Once patient is enrolled in the study, the child's prescriptions are written by a National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) psychiatrist who is working with the study team.   with the additional DMDD supplement.  Additionally, based on record review and  Recruitment Table 1A Continued Open access interviews with the child and parent, the clinical research team must agree that if the child is in active treatment, the child's response to their current treatment is no more than minimal determined by a score of 3 or more on the CGI-S. Unless there is an acute clinical need, participants must have no planned changes in outpatient psychiatric treatment regimen, which can include any psychotropic medications and/or psychotherapeutic interventions, 2 weeks prior to enrollment and throughout the weeks of treatment and post-treatment assessment. Participants are excluded if the irritability symptoms are due to the direct physiological effects of a drug, or to a general medical or neurological condition. Additionally, participants who meet DSM-5 criteria, as assessed by the K-SADS-PL,  for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective illness, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), major depressive episode, or post-traumatic stress disorder, are also excluded. ASD exclusion is operationalized using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA),  the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS),  the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ)  and the Children's Communication Checklist-Second Edition (CCC-2)  Specifically, we use cut-off scores of >75 on SRS, >15 on SCQ and <-15 on CCC. When one of these scores is above cut-off, with a combination of a DAWBA score, that is, ≥4, the participant is excluded. Participants are not eligible if they exhibit active suicidality or any cardinal bipolar symptoms, such as elevated or expansive mood, grandiosity or inflated self-esteem, and\or decreased need for sleep. Participants with other comorbid psychiatric problems (e.g., ADHD, anxiety disorders, past major depressive disorder; MDD) are not excluded from participation in this study. Study design Forty youth meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. Table  provides a detailed schedule of enrollment and intervention as well as a list of each of the measures being collected at each time point in the trial timeline. Each participant undergoes a randomised baseline observation period of 2, 4 or 6 weeks, followed by active treatment, and finally, post-treatment and follow-up observation periods (at 3 months and at 6 months following treatment termination). The multiple baseline design of the study controls for overall effects of time and regression towards the mean.  Rating clinicians (table ) are blinded to randomisation status of the participant and the timepoint the participant is in the trial at the time of the rating to control for clinician expectations. Randomisation to the different baseline points is independent to whether or not participants completed IBT study prior to starting the current protocol. Follow-up clinician-reported, child-reported and parent-reported primary and secondary outcomes are obtained at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. All visits are at the NIMH. All participants receive the active treatment.  Twelve weekly sessions last 60-90 min in an NIMH outpatient clinic, with both individual and joint child and parent meetings. There is one primary clinician treating the youth. Therapeutic procedures engaged in sessions are outlined in table 1A,B).  available upon request The manual involves a variety of exposure-based CBT procedures, such as creating hierarchies of irritabilityinducing events, exposure exercises (e.g., role-play, in vivo and imaginal), and PMT techniques (e.g., praise/ acknowledgement, pleasant interactions and unexpected rewards).    The exposures and the modules in the PMT are designed to be flexibly delivered and tailored for the specific issues and anger-inducing triggers identified by the individual child and their parents; therefore, the PMT modules will be adapted to account for age differences and will address the most salient problem areas identified using parent feedback. The main clinical outcomes we plan to assess are changes in irritability and overall illness severity and improvement. Changes in irritability will be assessed biweekly by clinician raters. Illness severity will be assessed biweekly and improvement will be assessed at mid-treatment and posttreatment. Illness severity at the end of the treatment will be compared with pre-treatment severity to determine the treatment's impact on the patient's overall severity of illness and to ascertain a frequently used global designation of 'responder' status.  The secondary clinical outcomes that will be assessed are child-reported and parent-reported irritability assessed weekly, and in vivo ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measures of mood and impairment, assessed pre-treatment, mid-treatment and post-treatment. Post hoc additional symptom measures include clinician-rated depressive and anxiety symptoms and functional impairment assessed biweekly. Additional secondary child-rated and parent-rated clinical outcomes include depressive and anxiety symptoms and aggression reported at pretreatment and post-treatment. Modifications made due to COVID-19 Due to the circumstances of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, recruitment was paused for about 5 months (Mid-March to mid-August 2020). To accommodate the protocol, we are continuing to adhere to the manual and provide treatment remotely. For patients going through the trial when the stay-at-home orders started, we shifted to telehealth. Exposures continue to be conducted and, in some ways, have benefited from being able to use the home as context in the exposures and parents being more at home to use in the exposures. Scans had stopped since mid-March. Procedures for administration of clinical, child and parent report measures, as well as EMA, stayed similar as to the rest of the trial, with the exception of the presession ARI allowed to be collected up to 2 days before the session for the pre-session, and postsession alliance measures allowed to be collected almost a week after the session. Self-report and parent report measures require more effort to assure compliance as these are collected remotely and via technology as opposed to on site as  Open access Continued Open access before. For the clinician ARI, clinicians consider the new circumstances of virtual schooling and being more at home, when evaluating impairment at school, at home and with peers. To protect privacy and due to lack of feasibility, sessions are no longer being recorded. While attempting to both, address some of the mental health burdens brought on by the pandemic and being compliant with protocol modules, it is challenging to address all the additional pandemic-related mental health difficulties such as kids' outbursts being more severe or parents changing their parenting style due to elevated stress. The potential effect of the pandemic on the results will be tested during data analysis, comparing and/or controlling the two groups of kids recruited before and after the pandemic outbreak. Discontinuation/modification criteria The criteria for discontinuing the trial include the patients' request to discontinue or if the participant's condition worsens. All participants are informed that they may discontinue participation at their request at any time and for any reason and that they will not lose any benefits to which they are otherwise entitled. Also, if a participant's condition worsens to where it would be deemed unsafe or clinically inappropriate for participation to continue as determined by the clinical team, then participant will be withdrawn from the trial. The patient's own care providers in the community would be contacted to discuss immediate care. Patient and public involvement For 2 years prior to the development of the treatment, informal focus groups were conducted with children with severe irritability to assess the priorities, potential experience and preferences of the children and family for whom the treatment was being developed. Questions during these informal meetings centred around preferred goals of the treatment, what parents and children were willing to do (questions on burden to participant and motivation), and identification of appropriate language for communications with the public to increase recruitment and interest. The research team also engaged in discussions with community providers during local and national presentations. The feedback from families and clinical professionals were geared towards making the treatment more generalizable, acceptable, feasible and equitable for the patient population under study. Measures Table  provides a clinical assessment timeline. In addition, treatment constructs are summarised in table . Primary outcome measures include the CL-ARI  to measure changes in irritability and CGI-Severity (CGI-S)    and CGI-Improvement (CGI-I)  scales to measure overall illness severity and improvement, respectively. The CL-ARI is a 12 items semistructured interview for DMDD designed to be administered by a trained clinician (master's level or above) to parents and children. The CL-ARI total score is the weighted sum of three subscale scores: temper outbursts (range of 0-27), irritable mood between outbursts (range of 0-8) and impairment (range of 0-15). Items are scored on Likert scales. Temper outburst frequency is scored on a 5-point scale, separately for mild, moderate and severe outbursts (0=none, 4=more than one outburst every day). Temper outburst duration is scored on a 6-point scale (0=none, 5=60 min). The irritable mood frequency item has a  Open access 4-point scale (0=none, 3=four or more days). The irritable mood duration item queries whether irritable mood was present for most of the day (i.e., at least half the day with a yes/no response option), and is only completed if the irritable mood frequency rating is scored at the maximum score (3=four or more days). The irritable mood severity item has a 6-point scale (0=not present, 5=severe). Last, impairment is rated separately in three different settings (family, school, peers) on 6-point scales (0=none, 5=severe). CL-ARI had a good reliabilty (Cronbach'sα=0.89) and validity scores.  CGI-S is is a single-item, 7-point measure of overall DMDD severity (1=normal, 7=most extreme) over the past month. The CGI scales are commonly used in psychiatric clinical trials, for which they have established utility and reliability.  Secondary outcome measures include parent and child report of irritability (child-rated and parent-rated ARI).  Additionally, we probe other co-occurring phenotypes in study, using clinician ratings of depressive symptoms (Children's Depression Rating Scale),  anxiety symptoms (Paediatric Anxiety Rating Scale)  and functional impairment (Children's Global Assessment Scale).  Children and parents provide reports on the child's symptoms of anxiety (Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders-child, SCARED  ; and SCAREDparent,  , respectively), aggression (Modified Overt Aggression Scale),  and depression (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, MFQ).  All of these measures demonstrated good internal consistency and discriminant validity in previous studies. Finally, EMA measures, a form of real-time digitally based event sampling are obtained to augment clinical phenotyping procedures, in addition to traditional clinical rating data.  Parents and children are prompted by smartphones for 7 days, three times per day, to answer questions about child symptoms and outbursts (occurring both, 'at the time of the beep' and 'since the last beep'), and functional impairment, and corresponded parental responses. The effect of the treatment on EMA measures will be assessed. Data quality of all measures in this study is continually monitored and checked postcollection. Treatment process measures Adherence measures were developed for this study to assess therapist fidelity and competence. With informed consent and assent, all treatment sessions are video recorded or audio recorded. Following each session, therapists rate themselves on adherence measures, and external raters blind to clinical outcome complete additional, observer ratings based on the recordings. Therapists, patients, parents and independent raters also assess the therapeutic alliance following every session.    To improve adherence and minimise drift, group supervision facilitated by the developer of the treatment where the manual is reviewed is conducted weekly throughout the trial. Study therapists review each other's session recordings to provide feedback during supervision. Neuroimaging measures At pre-treatment, mid-treatment and post-treatment, participants complete resting state,  as well as a frustration fMRI task (Affective Posner (AP3)).  At pretreatment and post-treatment, participants complete a threat attention orienting task (Dot-Probe)    and an instrumental reward learning task (Carnival) that also includes a frustration induction. Finally, diffusion tensor imaging,  a structural neuroimaging measure of neural circuitry, is also collected pre-treatment to estimate the location, orientation and anisotropy of the brain's white matter tracts. Scans are completed within 3 weeks of pre-treatment (session 1) and post-treatment (session 12). To ensure that all participants have the same exposure to stimuli, participants who are unable or unwilling to scan (e.g., braces) complete these tasks behaviorally outside of the scanner. fMRI tasks AP3 Task This task models frustrative non-reward by inducing, and then violating, the expectation of reward during an attention orienting task (see figure  for task overview). The task is organised into three blocks consisting of a series of timed-response trials in which participants identify a target following a cue (i.e., Posner task).  At the end of each trial, children receive accuracy feedback, and, after the first block, win or lose money on each trial. On all trials, a black screen is presented between the target/ response and the feedback slide. During the first block, participants are told to respond as quickly as possible to the stimuli and that there is no reward or punishment, but they receive feedback on their accuracy. This block consists two non-frustration runs outside the scanner that set up the expectation for reward. During the second block, inside the scanner, participants are introduced to the monetary contingency and win or lose US$0.50 when they make a correct or incorrect response, respectively. The third block, inside the scanner, is the frustration condition, during which feedback is rigged such that 60% of correct trials are followed by negative feedback and a loss of US$0.50, and 40% of correct responses are followed by positive feedback and a gain of US$0.50. Trials in which participants make incorrect responses are followed by accurate feedback. Finally, fixation trials, during which participants focus on a fixation mark in the centre of the screen, are included to facilitate comparisons between brain activity during task trials following wining/losing. At the end of each block, participants are asked to report the valence of their emotional response and their level of frustration. The AP3 task  is a wellestablished task used in multiple studies, including in the context of DMDD,  to investigate the circuitry mediating frustration. Previous studies demonstrate that in response to negative feedback received in the context of frustration, children with severe, chronic irritability are showing abnormal activations in regions implicated in emotion, attention, and reward processing. Open access Dot-Probe Task This task measures threat-related attention orientation. There is an expanding literature using this task showing threat-related  attention bias in samples with high levels of anxiety and irritability. To date, fMRI research using the dot-probe task yields generally consistent findings of individual differences in anxiety related to perturbed function in brain regions supporting emotional processing (e.g., amygdala) and attentional control (e.g., ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, vlPFC; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dlPFC).  In the current study, participants complete a faces-based variant of the dot-probe task,  (following the TAU-NIMH ABMT Initiative protocol (http:// people. socsci. tau. ac. il/ mu/ anxietytrauma/ research/). The task includes 120 trials: 80 threat-neutral and 40 neutralneutral (see figure  for task trial (see figure  for task overview). In each trial, a pair of faces appears following a fixation cross. Following the face display, a probe appears on the screen (i.e., '<' or '>') in the location of a previously viewed either neutral (i.e., incongruent trials) or threatening face (i.e., congruent trials). Participants are instructed to indicate the orientation of the probe by clicking the left or right button of a button box. The probe remains on screen until a response is registered, and then the next trial begins. Attention bias to threat scores are calculated from reaction times (RTs) on the threat-neutral face display trials by subtracting congruent trial RTs from incongruent trial RTs.  Positive attention bias to threat scores reflect a bias towards threat; negative scores reflect a bias away from threat. The Dot-Probe task starts with a resting state phase measuring pre-task brain activity at rest.   Carnival task This task is designed to examine reward vs loss learning in relation to irritability, both at baseline and following an acute frustration induction, and to investigate neural substrates involved in these processes. There are no previous studies examining reward learning per se in the context of DMDD. Related studies showed striatal dysfunction in the context of reward learning as compared with healthy youth.  Youth with conduct problems, showed   et al (2009) that is available to the public. We followed the terms and conditions listed for using the set and agreed to use the images for research purposes only. The manuscript includes models that are listed as ones which are permitted to be published in scientific journals (see this link for more details: https://www. macbrain.org/resources.htm). Open access atypical modulation of striatal activity based on stimulus expected value.  The task simulates a set of Carnival games and has three phases (see figure  for task overview). In the first and last phases, participants view pairs of objects on the left and right sides of the computer screen, respectively. The paired stimuli are in different colours, and switch their location on the screen randomly. Participants hold a grip force response device (dynamometer) in each hand, and grip one of the devices while the stimuli are on the screen in order to select that stimulus in an attempt to obtain a monetary reward (US$0.50). After participants respond, the screen acknowledges their selection by showing an image of a mallet overlaid on the selected stimulus. Next, a feedback screen appears indicating whether the selected stimulus is rewarded: 'Win 50¢!' or 'No Win.' During this phase, participants learn over the course of three different sets of paired stimuli to select the stimulus that is followed more frequently by reward. In the second or middle phase, participants view images on the screen that simulate a whack-a-mole game. For 40% of participants' correct responses, the selection is followed by a reward ('Win 50¢!'). For the other 60% of correct responses, feedback is rigged, or followed by no reward ('No Win'). Incorrect responses are always followed by no reward. All images are original to the task. At the end of each phase, participants rate their levels of frustration, excitement and unhappiness.  Baseline assignment Baseline assignment sequence is created via a computerbased random number generator. Randomisation is performed in blocks of 10 participants with a 1:1 ratio within blocks. Rating clinicians are blind as to the current trial phase at time of ratings, as well as the baseline condition assignment. The blind is not broken for the entire cohort until completion of the trial. Sample size and power analysis The sample size of this study is expected to include N=40 completers. To account for dropout, we have determined the total sample size of enrolment to be N=60. Medium to large effects (d=0.6-1.2) were detected in the pilot treatment conducted in our group using the current manual.  There is no standard power analysis for multiple baseline designs. However, prior studies using this design with similar effect sizes generally have enrolled 6-18 participants.  Various meta-analyses estimate the effect size of the psychological treatment/psychological placebo difference to be 0.40-0.60.  A sensitivity-power analyses using G*Power v3.1 showed that with 40 participants, an error rate of 0.05 and a power of 0.95, a large effect size of d=0.81 is required, using within-subjects analyses, while accounting multiple comparisons corrections.  Since in the current study all participants receive an active treatment, we expect the effect size to be above and beyond placebo effect reported in the literature, and to be large in magnitude. We will use intention-to-treat analyses for noncompliance and missing outcomes, using last observation carried forward approach.   Data analysis We will test the null hypothesis of no difference in DMDD symptoms improvement between time points across the randomised baseline schedules. Both visual inspection Open access of the data and multilevel modelling in which repeated trials are nested within each subject will be used.  Mixed models will be performed to examine symptom change over time for each of the ARI measures (clinician, child and parent rated) and the clinician-rated anxiety and depressive symptom measures. The slopes of the baseline phase will be modelled and compared with the slopes of the treatment phase to identify differential slopes between phases. Effect sizes will be calculated to assess if the treatment is associated with symptom improvement in clinician-rated severity of illness and functioning, and parent and child rated anxiety, depression and aggression. In addition to calculating statistical significance for all inferential tests, we will calculate clinically significant change for ARI measures and secondary outcome measures, using the method recommended by Jacobson and Truax.  CGI-I, a measure of improvement, will also be used to determine clinical change. For EMA ratings, we will use multilevel modelling to evaluate a pre-to-post-treatment increase in parental rewards for adaptive child behaviour, and decrease in rewards for irritable behaviour. Although the current design does not allow us to measure adjunctive versus separate effects of PMT vs exposure, based on sessions recording, we will calculate the dosage of each intervention at the individual level, and measure associations between intervention type proportion and treatment efficacy/clinical change. fMRI analyses will test for pre-treatment vs post-treatment differences in frontostriatal engagement after frustrative nonreward (AP3 and Carnival) and in frontostriatal-amygdala engagement during threat processing (Dot-probe). For each task, fMRI analysis will also compare pre-treatment and post-treatment resting state connectivity. For the AP3 task, we will compare activation on the N+1 trial after rigged versus positive feedback. The AP3 task will also be used to examine whether neural changes at mid-treatment predate or mediate clinical symptom change at post-treatment. Resting state data will explore changes in default mode, attentional and salience networks over the course of treatment. For each task, we will calculate separateanalyses of variance for CGI-I and CL-ARI to test post-treatment ratings × task condition × time (scan 1, 2) interactions. The model for CL-ARI will covary pre-treatment ratings. ETHICS To participate, parents must give written informed consent and the children must provide written assent. The research project and all related materials were submitted and approved by the appropriate IRB of the NIMH, which deemed the study to involve minimal risks. Adverse experiences include mild psychological distress and discomfort when responding to interview questions or questionnaires, engaging in the exposure-based treatment, or boredom during scanning or tasking. The principal and associate investigators monitor patients closely (e.g., at least weekly) throughout their participation in the study. Data management and monitoring Questionnaires and clinical ratings' data are managed through an IRB-approved password-protected institutional secure database, NIH Clinical Trials Database. Only approved NIMH staff have access to these data. Hard copy data/records with identifiers are double locked. Data for EMA is collected using secure technology, with procedures approved by the NIH's Information Systems Security Officer. Data and safety are monitored by the principal investigator with a focus on clinical outcome, medication management and adverse events (AE). Data are also monitored by an independent data safety monitor from the NIH. The NIH's Science Review committee deemed that a data safety monitoring committee was not needed given the minimal risk category of the study and the capacity for the clinical staff and research team to closely monitor participants. Annual continuing reviews are conducted by the NIH's IRB to determine continuation of the research. Any serious AE will be reviewed and handled by the principal investigator, independent monitor and IRB. Any protocol modification must first be submitted as an amendment to the IRB and approved before their implementation. The research protocol is audited by the institution's Office of Regulatory Oversight to ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practice, organisational policies and regulations. Dissemination The study results will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at national and international conferences, presentations at local school districts PTAs, presentations to community providers and to local advocacy and professional group organisations, and posted on the lab's website and through a lab newsletter that will be distributed to all lab and study participants.

1,1,An Ecological Momentary Assessment of College Women's Decisions to Use Protective Behavioral Strategies,"Nearly one quarter of college women experience sexual assault in the United States . Risk for victimization is particularly high among younger students (i.e., those under the age of 21) who engage in heavy episodic drinking (HED; i.e., consuming four or more drinks on a single occasion; . Even women who typically consume less are at increased risk on days when they consume more than their typical amounts . The underlying mechanisms that explain the association between alcohol and sexual assault risk are well-established and multifaceted (see . Studies show that men perceive intoxicated women to be more sexually available or interested ; women who are drinking heavily also have a delayed recognition of and response to sexual assault risk. As such, perpetrators may be more inclined to prey on women who are drinking. Although sexual assault risk only exists in the presence of a perpetrator, alcohol is involved in over 50% of sexual assaults that occur on college campuses , warranting prevention strategies that address alcohol-related risk . Sexual assault risk reduction programs are an integral component of comprehensive prevention efforts and address multiple risk and protective factors . Risk reduction programs assert sexual assault is always the perpetrator's fault and also empower women to minimize the likelihood they will be targeted as a potential victim . A core mechanism of this prevention approach has been to increase use of sexual assault protective behavioral strategies (PBS; . Sexual assault PBS include strategies for setting and communicating personal boundaries (e.g., determining in advance what one is willing to do in a sexual situation) and deterring harm in situations where sexual assault risk may be present (e.g., walking home with trusted friends, being prepared to use forceful verbal or physical resistance strategies if necessary; . Several attempts have been made to tailor this risk reduction approach for heavy drinking women . These programs have typically expanded the discussion of PBS to include drinking PBS, which aim to limit alcohol consumption (e.g., consuming no more than one drink per hour; planning not to exceed three drinks in a night) or modify the manner of drinking (e.g., alternating alcohol and non-alcoholic beverages; avoiding shots) to minimize the potential negative effects of intoxication . Whereas sexual assault PBS have been directly associated with decreased sexual assault victimization in college women , drinking PBS have been indirectly associated with fewer incidents of forced and unwanted sex by first reducing alcohol consumption . Several rigorous evaluation studies of risk reduction programs have reported significant effects on sexual assault victimization (e.g.,  and alcohol-involved sexual assault, specifically . Program impacts on PBS use have been less consistent, especially in samples of heavy drinkers . This gap could be a function of measurement specificity. Prospective evaluation studies measure typical PBS use averaged over several months . This level of measurement does not account for whether or how women tailor their PBS use in response to interpersonal or contextual risk on a given day. Existing programs may also be insufficiently addressing the upstream factors that motivate an individual to use PBS . Relatively little is known about the processes that inform women's decisions to use PBS, and no studies have examined these processes on days when women drink and may be at increased risk for victimization. A better understanding of the malleable constructs that inform PBS use on drinking days is needed to enhance prevention efforts. Decisions to Use PBS Research shows women's decisions to use PBS can be complex, operating through core processes that are both planned (i.e., intentional) and emotionally reactive (i.e., one's willingness to use PBS based on the social situation; . Studies reveal that intentions and willingness tend to be positively associated, but when examined simultaneously, they each account for significant unique variance in predicting behavioral outcomes (e.g., .  observed women's intentions and willingness were positively correlated with each other (r = .78), but each accounted for unique and significant proportions of variance in predicting future sexual assault PBS use. The role of intentions in PBS use is consistent with prior literature that has shown positive health behaviors (e.g., healthy eating) tend to be more intentional or planned compared to health risk behaviors (e.g., substance use), which tend to be more reactive . Studies such as these tend to examine associations between intentions/willingness assessed at one time and behavioral outcomes assessed a month to several months later. The limitation of this approach is that it does not account for situational changes in decision making or PBS use. The current study attempted to fill this gap by examining event-level intentions and willingness to use PBS and behavioral outcomes on days when women might be at increased risk for victimization. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is an event-level methodology that allows for repeated measurement of events, experiences, or behaviors as they occur in real time and in participants' natural environments . The EMA approach provides a method to examine the answers to more nuanced process-based questions, such as: (a) Does the influence of decision-theoretical constructs (intentions and willingness) on PBS use vary from day to day? (b) Does the influence vary within a day leading up to a drinking event? (c) Is the influence of within-or between-day variability affected by individuals' typical decision-making patterns? Answers to these questions could provide insight into factors that decrease risk on a given day and inform the optimal timing and theoretical targets for interventions. For example, observed variability in the influence of intentions on PBS use from one day to the next might suggest existing risk reduction programs could be enhanced by encouraging women to consistently plan for what PBS they might use when they go out. Alternatively, observing variability within a day (e.g., if PBS use becomes more likely as intentions increase throughout the day) might suggest the need for supplemental event-specific interventions that make PBS use seem appealing right before or throughout a night out. Understanding these processes can help inform the nature of prevention efforts to increase overall PBS use, empower women to think about which PBS may be most beneficial in different situations, and subsequently reduce harm. The Current Study The current study used a 14-day EMA design to examine decision-making constructs associated with sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS. To understand the decision-making processes women use on days when they could be at increased risk for victimization, the current study examined PBS used only on drinking days. Further, drinking days are plausible and easily identifiable targets for intervention, both globally and at the event-level. Research suggests that, on average, women use more sexual assault PBS when they have greater intentions and willingness to do so . The current study aimed to explore these associations at the event level for both sexual assault and drinking PBS by answering the following research questions (RQ): (a) Do women use more sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so are higher than normal (e.g., withinperson/between-day effects)? (b) Do women use more sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so increase throughout the day, relative to when they decrease or stay the same (e.g., within-day effects)? (c) Do event-level associations between PBS use and decision-theoretical constructs vary based on one's average overall levels of intentions and willingness (e.g., between-person by within-person interaction effects)? These hypothesized associations were tested separately for sexual assault and drinking PBS because they may require unique intervention approaches for increased use. The effects of intentions and willingness were examined simultaneously (e.g., the effect of willingness controlling for one's average level of intentions) because previous research has identified both as being integral and complementary in the behavioral decision-making process . Answers to these questions will provide critical insight into how typical risk reduction approaches might be enhanced to address HED and event-level risk. Method Recruitment A random sample of 750 women was selected from the university registrar's database of incoming students at a large, public northeastern university. Students received personalized introductory letters and email invitations describing the study and containing a URL and PIN for accessing a consent form and brief web-based screening survey. Non-respondents received up to seven personalized email reminders. Approximately, 58% (n = 436) enrolled and completed the screening, resulting in a response rate comparable to other studies using similar web-based recruitment methods with new students transitioning into the university (e.g., . Over half of enrolled students met eligibility criteria (54%; n = 235), which included (a) having a 4G network smartphone and (b) reporting at least one heavy drinking episode in the past month (i.e., consuming four or more drinks on a single occasion; . Ineligible students were paid $5 and removed from the participant list. Eligible students were directed to the baseline assessment and paid $15 for their time. Students also earned a $5 rapid completion bonus if they completed the survey within 3 days of the initial invitation. EMA Study Procedures Following baseline assessment, two-thirds of participants (n = 156) were randomly selected for the EMA study; the remaining third was assigned to a reactivity control group. Students assigned to the current study were directed to a scheduling tool and invited to continue in the study by signing up for a required training on Snap Mobile, a mobile phone application used for daily data collection. Research staff made up to two phone calls and sent three additional emails to follow up with eligible students who did not schedule electronically or to reschedule participants who missed their scheduled session; participants also received text message reminders the night before their selected training session. Approximately, 54% (n = 84) of those invited, or 19% of all screened participants, attended training and enrolled in the EMA study. There were no significant differences between students who enrolled and students who did not enroll on age, race/ethnicity, baseline drinking, or PBS use (all ps > .05). The current study employed a 14-day event-and signal-contingent EMA protocol. Upon waking each morning, participants logged into their Snap Mobile app to complete a short survey of the previous day's drinking and PBS use. At the end of this morning survey, participants also completed their first prospective momentary assessments of intentions and willingness to use PBS on that day. Two additional momentary assessments of intentions and willingness occurred randomly between 2:00 pm and 6:00 pm and between 7:00 pm and 11:00 pm each day. Text message reminders were sent at 9:00 am on weekdays/10:00 am on weekends, and again at 12:30 pm for daily diaries (the survey closed at 1:00 pm daily); reminders for the afternoon and evening momentary assessments were sent 30 minutes before each survey period closed. Participants received $30 for participation, with a $20 bonus if they achieved at least 90% compliance on the daily morning assessments. To further encourage compliance, participants were entered into a lottery for each survey they completed; five lottery winners were randomly selected at the end of the study, with prizes ranging from $50 to $250. All study procedures were reviewed and approved by the university's Institutional Review Board. Participants Only the days on which participants reported drinking were included in analyses, as the current study aimed to understand PBS use on drinking days. The final sample included 56 participants who reported at least 1 drinking event during the 14-day assessment period with corresponding momentary data from the prior day. The mean age of the sample was 18.05 years (SD = 0.23). Most participants identified as Caucasian (82.1%), although other racial/ethnic backgrounds were represented (10.7% African American, 5.4% multiracial, 5.5% Hispanic). All participants lived on campus, and many intended to join intramural/club sports (55.4%) or sororities (42.9%) in their first semester. At baseline, participants reported consuming an average of 8.71 (SD = 6.06) drinks per week. Measures PBS If participants reported drinking the day/night before, within their daily waking recall assessments, they were asked to indicate which, if any, PBS they used (1 = Yes; 0 = No). For both types of PBS, briefer versions of established scales were used to keep daily assessments short and minimize response burden . The sexual assault PBS measure included six items from the Dating Self-Protection Against Rape Scale . Items were selected based on preliminary work identifying the types of behaviors women tend to use most frequently . Sample items included, ""Letting a friend or family member know where you are,"" and ""Walking home with a trusted friend."" A summed score was created to indicate the number of sexual assault PBS used on each drinking occasion. The drinking PBS measure included six items from the Protective Behavioral Strategies Scale . Items with factor loadings of at least 0.65  were selected from each subscale, including Stopping/Limiting Drinking (e.g., determined in advance not to exceed a set number of drinks), Manner of Drinking (e.g., avoided trying to keep up with or out drink others), and Serious Harm Reduction (e.g., tried to know where my drink was at all times). A summed score was created to indicate the number of drinking PBS used on each drinking occasion. Behavior-specific Intentions Each of the three daily momentary assessments asked participants about the activities they intended to engage in later that day. They were asked, ""Do you 'intend' to engage in any social activities today/tonight?"" (1 = Yes; 0 = No) and ""Do you 'intend' to drink?"" (1 = Yes; 0 = No). If drinking intentions were affirmed, participants also indicated which, if any, PBS from the lists above they intended to use (1 = Yes; 0 = No). Summed scores were created to indicate the number of sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS participants intended to use within each drinking occasion. Behavior-specific Willingness Similar to intentions, participants were presented with willingness questions specific to each behavior. They were asked, ""Are you 'willing' to engage in social activities tonight, should the opportunity arise?"" (1 = Yes; 0 = No) and ""Are you 'willing' to drink?"" (1 = Yes; 0 = No). If affirmed, participants indicated which sexual assault and drinking PBS they were willing to use (1 = Yes; 0 = No). Summed scores indicated the number of sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS participants were willing to use on each occasion. Analytic Strategy A series of four multilevel regression models were estimated in SAS (v. 9.4) to examine within-person/between-day effects (RQ1), within-day effects (RQ2), and cross-level interaction effects (RQ3; between-person X withinperson/day) of decision-theoretic constructs (intentions and willingness) on daily PBS use. Prior to analysis, waking recall assessments of the prior day's PBS use were lagged by one day and merged to match with the previous day's momentary assessments of intentions and willingness. Because predictor variables were assessed at a lower level (within day) than the outcome variables (between day), the lower level data (three momentary assessments of intentions and willingness within a day) were aggregated . Within-day aggregation was conducted in two ways to answer unique research questions. First, all three momentary assessments were averaged to create a day-level mean for intentions and willingness to use sexual assault and drinking PBS, respectively (RQ1). The second aggregation method created behavior-specific change scores ) by subtracting intention and willingness values reported at the first assessment within each day from the value reported at the third assessment within each day (RQ2). Positive values indicated an increase in intentions or willingness throughout the day, whereas negative values indicated a decrease. Missing data within the final analytic sample were handled using Full Information Maximum Likelihood , and outcome-specific unconditional means models confirmed the utility of the intended multilevel approach. The first set of models examined whether daily intentions and willingness to use PBS predicted actual PBS use on a given drinking day. Each behavioral outcome (sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS) was regressed onto behavior-specific day-level means of intentions and willingness. For example, sexual assault PBS use was regressed onto day-level means of intentions and willingness to use sexual assault PBS. To separate within-and betweenperson effects, predictors were group-mean centered at Level 1 (i.e., centered around the individual's mean) and grand-mean centered at Level 2 (i.e., centered around the sample mean). A second set of models examined whether within-day changes in intentions and willingness to use PBS predicted PBS use on a given drinking day. Again, using separate models for sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS, each behavioral outcome was regressed onto behavior-specific within-day changes in intentions and willingness to use PBS at Level 1 and grand-mean centered intentions and willingness to use PBS at Level 2. Within each model, we estimated both main effects (RQ1 & RQ2) and within-domain cross-level interactions (e.g., Level 1 intentions × Level 2 intentions; Level 1 willingness × Level 2 willingness; RQ3). Results Participants provided 368 total assessments (M = 6.57/person). Intraclass correlation coefficients from the unconditional means models indicated .85 of the variability in sexual assault PBS and .78 of the variability in drinking PBS occurred between-persons, leaving 15% and 22% of the variability, respectively, to be accounted for at the event-level. Results from the multilevel models predicting both sexual assault and drinking PBS are included in Table . For each outcome, results of RQ1 (between-day effects of intentions and willingness) are presented in the top panel and results of RQ2 (withinday changes in intentions and willingness) are presented in the bottom panel. The cross-level interaction terms within each panel (Rows 6, 7, 12, and 13) represent results for RQ3. Each will be discussed in turn. On any given drinking day, assuming average levels of PBS intentions and willingness, women used 2.76 (SE = 0.12) sexual assault PBS and 2.90 (SE = 0.17) drinking PBS (Table , Row 1). The main effects of daily intentions and willingness to use PBS on PBS use were not significant for either outcome (Rows 4 and 5). Thus, there was no evidence to suggest women used more sexual assault PBS or drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so were higher than normal. RQ2: Do Women Use More PBS on Days When Their Intentions and Willingness to Do So Increase Throughout the Day? Consistent with the first set of models, on any given drinking day, and assuming average intentions and willingness, women used 2.76 (SE = 0.13) sexual assault PBS and 2.74 (SE = 0.19) drinking PBS (Table , Row 8). There was a positive association between within-day changes in willingness and sexual assault PBS use (Row 12), such that at average levels of intentions, each 1-unit increase in willingness was associated with a 0.15 (SE = 0.06) increase in PBS use. In other words, women reported their highest sexual assault PBS use on days when their willingness to use sexual assault PBS increased throughout the day. Within-day changes in intentions to use sexual assault PBS were not significantly associated with sexual assault PBS use (Row 11). There were no significant associations between within-day changes in intentions and willingness and drinking PBS use (Rows 11 and 12). RQ3: Do Event-level Associations Between PBS Use and Decision-theoretical Constructs Vary Based on One's Average Overall Levels of Intentions and Willingness? Sexual Assault PBS Across both models, and consistent with global theories of behavior change (e.g., , the between-person effects of both intentions and willingness to use sexual assault PBS were positively associated with number of PBS used (Table , Rows 2, 3, 9, and 10). Individuals who reported greater intentions and willingness to use sexual assault PBS, on average, also reported using a greater number of sexual assault PBS, compared to individuals who reported lower average intentions and willingness to use sexual assault PBS. Building on this work, RQ3 examined whether event-level associations between PBS use and decision-theoretical constructs vary based on one's average overall levels of intentions and willingness. The between-person by daily average interactions were not significant (Rows 6 and 7), suggesting the non-significant event-level associations described above (RQ1) were consistent across all women in the sample; they did not vary based on one's typical levels of intentions and willingness. However, the between-person by withinday change interaction was significant for willingness to use sexual assault PBS (Row 14), suggesting the positive association between within-day changes in willingness and sexual assault PBS use (RQ2 above) might vary depending on one's typical willingness to use sexual assault PBS. To probe the nature of this interaction, the interaction was graphed in Figure . Separate lines are used to indicate the within-day association among individuals who reported (a) average (mean), (b) above-average (1 SD above the mean), and (c) below-average (1 SD below the mean) levels of overall willingness to use sexual assault PBS. The interaction was further probed by calculating the simple slopes and region of significance for each of the three between-person levels of sexual assault PBS willingness . Women who had average and below-average levels of overall willingness to use sexual assault PBS reported increased sexual assault PBS use on days when their willingness to use those PBS increased throughout the day (p < .01). This association was not significant for women with overall above-average levels of sexual assault PBS willingness; these women used the highest number of sexual assault PBS regardless of any within-day fluctuations in willingness. Drinking PBS. Across both models, the between-person association (Level 2) between willingness to use drinking PBS and PBS use was significant (Table , Rows 3 and 10), suggesting that individuals who, on average, reported willingness to use more drinking PBS also reported using a greater number of drinking PBS over the period of assessment. There was a significant cross-level interaction of between-person by daily average willingness to use drinking PBS (Row 7), suggesting that even though no event-level association between willingness and drinking PBS use was found when we examined main effects (RQ1 above), there may be an event-level association for certain individuals. Further probing (see Figure ) revealed individuals who, on average, reported the lowest overall level of drinking PBS willingness (i.e., below-average) decreased their PBS use on days when they reported more than their typical amount of willingness to use drinking PBS (p < .05). The simple slopes for the other between-person levels of drinking PBS willingness (i.e., average and aboveaverage) trended in the expected direction but were not significant. No other significant interaction effects were observed; intentions did not predict drinking PBS use at any level. Figure Effects of Between-Person Drinking PBS Willingness on the Association Discussion The current study aimed to enhance existing risk reduction programs by examining event-level variability in the decision-making processes that influence PBS use using an EMA study design. First, we examined whether women used more sexual assault and drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so were higher than normal. Findings did not support this hypothesis. This was surprising, as previous work indicates women regularly use a number of sexual assault PBS already , suggesting they are generally aware of social and environmental risks. One notable difference from this prior work was that our study focused solely on women in their first semester of college. These women may still be learning about social and environmental risk factors, suggesting a need to understand how PBS use and motivations for use differ between first year students and their more senior counterparts. At the event-level, specific contextual factors may impact women's risk perceptions and, in turn, their decisions to use sexual assault PBS on a given day. Women tend to be less willing to use sexual assault PBS in situations where they are socializing with someone they know because they do not think of that person as a potential perpetrator . Students may also be less willing to use drinking PBS if they have competing intentions to drink, as drinking PBS focus on limiting alcohol consumption. This effect might be heightened by affiliation with groups that support a heavy drinking culture (e.g., athletic teams, Greek life). Future event-level studies of PBS decision making should examine the role of contextual factors, such as with whom and in what environments women socialize, and between-person differences that might further explain event-level processes. Next, we asked whether women used more sexual assault and drinking PBS on days when their intentions and willingness to do so increased throughout the day relative to days when their intentions and willingness decreased or stayed the same. Whereas no significant findings were observed for drinking PBS, women reported their highest sexual assault PBS use on days when their willingness to use sexual assault PBS increased throughout the day. This might suggest that women adjust their sexual assault PBS as they coordinate with friends or learn more about their plans through the day (e.g., where they are going, who they will see). Future research should explore what factors impact shifts in sexual assault PBS willingness, as well as between-person differences in who adjusts their willingness and PBS use versus those who do not. Interventions might be enhanced by encouraging women to learn as much as possible about the events they plan to attend (e.g., where they are going, what could happen in that setting) so they can proactively consider which PBS they might be willing to use in each situation. The third research question examined whether event-level associations between PBS use and willingness and intentions varied based on individuals' average levels of willingness and intentions. Consistent with global theories of behavior change and prior PBS-specific studies (e.g., , we did observe significant between-person effects such that women who reported more willingness to use both types of PBS, on average, also endorsed greater use. The between-person effect of intentions was significant for sexual assault PBS only, indicating women who reported higher average intentions were more likely to use PBS such as walking home with a friend. The impact of these between-person effects on event-level decision making varied based on the PBS type. For sexual assault PBS, a significant between-person by within-day change interaction was observed. Women who had below-average and average levels of willingness to use sexual assault PBS reported the highest actual use on days when their willingness to use sexual assault PBS increased; this pattern was not observed for women with above-average levels of overall willingness. Examination of Figure  suggests we may be observing a ceiling effect among above-average sexual assault PBS users. These women are regularly using sexual assault PBS at high rates with little room to increase. Findings suggest women who typically are less willing to use sexual assault PBS may benefit from eventlevel types of intervention to increase their willingness prior to higher risk occasions involving alcohol or potential sexual encounters , and that existing prevention efforts could focus on positively reinforcing the PBS use that is already happening. When examining cross-level interactions for drinking PBS, a different pattern of findings emerged. We observed a significant between-person by daily average interaction for willingness to use drinking PBS; women who tended to have the lowest overall willingness to use drinking PBS actually decreased their drinking PBS use on days when they reported more willingness to use them. There are several possible explanations for this finding that should be explored in future work. Perhaps these women are less successful with implementing these behaviors because they may be less familiar with using them or simply do not like to use them. It is also plausible that despite being more willing to use drinking PBS in advance of a drinking event, they may find themselves in an environment where they perceive none of their peers are using them, or that none of their peers would approve of their use. These women may be particularly affected by both drinking and PBS-specific normative influences . Either way, the findings are somewhat concerning because they highlight a lack of planning to use drinking PBS, and a lack of follow-through even when willingness is high. Interventions may need to strengthen the use of drinking PBS on a global level before event-level interventions are considered, and additional research may be needed to better understand normative influences and barriers associated with drinking PBS use. Notably, intraclass correlations revealed less event-level variability in PBS use than we expected to observe (15% for sexual assault PBS; 22% for drinking PBS), which may highlight several ways in which our study design could be strengthened in subsequent research. First, to minimize participant burden we chose to focus on college students' most commonly used PBS, yet decision-making processes may be different for less common PBS, especially if those are PBS women only use out of necessity (e.g., if a situation escalates and requires forceful physical resistance; . Expanding the number and types of PBS measured may capture the full range of strategies women choose to implement. More nuanced understanding of how women combine PBS and which PBS women use in different contexts would also better inform EMA measurement, and ultimately prevention . Second, post-hoc comparison of EMA participants to a reactivity control group suggested women may have increased PBS use in response to frequent assessment. While this is encouraging when considering the utility of momentary/event-level interventions to increase PBS use, it could have also resulted in reduced variability, or even over-reporting, of PBS use in daily assessments. Finally, we aimed to understand decisions leading up to drinking events, necessarily limiting analysis to drinking days. However, not all sexual assaults involve alcohol, and a woman's decision not to drink on a given day or in a specific context may be an intentional PBS. We may capture more event-level variability by examining a broader range of PBS and decisions to use PBS on both drinking and non-drinking days. Implications for Prevention Previous research has called for the integration and increased use of both sexual assault PBS and drinking PBS to enhance existing sexual assault prevention efforts . By examining women's decisions to use (or not use) PBS on drinking days, the current study serves as an initial step in providing an evidence-based way to help women utilize a ""toolkit"" of strategies that will help them to feel empowered and in control of their environment, while also reducing the likelihood they will be perceived by perpetrators as potential victims. Overwhelmingly, the current study highlights the need to increase intentions to use drinking PBS. Practitioners may consider using existing alcohol risk reduction strategies (e.g., motivational interviewing [MI; ; personalized normative feedback [PNF; ; parent-based intervention [PBI; ) and sexual assault risk reduction programs targeting heavy drinkers (e.g.,  to encourage women to think through common social scenarios and plan for which PBS they would use to minimize potential risk. Conversations that address barriers to using drinking PBS, like competing intentions to drink, might be enhanced by providing alternative strategies that can be used even if intentions to drink are high (e.g., alternating alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages vs. limiting to three or fewer drinks).  have successfully used similar approaches to increase women's use of forceful verbal and physical sexual assault resistance strategies in their Enhanced Assess, Acknowledge, Act (EAAA) program. Findings also revealed that intentions and willingness to use PBS operate at both between-person and within-person levels and may require different strategies to achieve behavior change. To address between-person differences, individuals who are more willing to use PBS may benefit from highlighting successful outcomes from prior PBS use to reinforce positive decisions. Those who are less willing to use PBS may require more intensive efforts to increase their willingness to use PBS, perhaps by first increasing their confidence in their ability to effectively use PBS . A similar approach to target within-person differences might be to reinforce intentions/willingness throughout the day, during an actual drinking event, or even prior to a potential sexual encounter, via text messages or interactive mobile apps. Because women are generally willing to use sexual assault PBS  and may increase use in response to frequent mobile assessment, interventions that reach them in the moments when they need to be used (or immediately before) may increase use during higherrisk occasions. Prevention scientists might consider supplementing efficacious individual-level interventions (e.g., MI, PNF, PBI, EAAA) with adaptive mobile components that aim to increase or maintain high levels of event-level PBS use. Event-level evaluation of PBS use following program exposure would provide valuable insight into how to structure supplemental intervention messaging, while capturing program impacts on PBS use that are not captured using more traditional longitudinal evaluation methods. Finally, practitioners and scientists alike might consider the utility of both sexual assault and drinking PBS in their prevention programs and research. Previous research shows women use more sexual assault PBS on days when they drink . This suggests sexual assault PBS may be particularly appealing and more likely to be used among drinkers. These strategies may enhance alcohol reduction programs' impact on sexual assault outcomes (e.g., . Further, sexual assault risk reduction programs are often sought out by women with prior victimization experience , who may be at increased risk for heavy drinking . Whereas most programs address alcohol as a situational risk factor, more robust discussion of drinking PBS may be useful for these women. Regardless of the setting, discussions of PBS use should be coupled with reminders that these strategies aim to reduce risk, but may not completely eliminate it. It is equally important to highlight that if women experience sexual assault even after using PBS, that does not imply the assault was their fault; sexual assault is always caused by a perpetrator. In a continued effort to shift the responsibility of sexual assault prevention away from potential victims, practitioners should implement both alcohol and sexual assault risk reduction programs in combination with efficacious programs that reduce community-level risk (e.g., bystander intervention;  and perpetration behaviors . Limitations and Future Directions Although careful controls were in place throughout the study, certain limitations remain. Our sample size was sufficient to address the proposed research questions, but findings would be strengthened from replication in a larger, more diverse sample of women who engage in different patterns of drinking (abstainers, light, moderate, and heavy). Including light and non-drinkers in future research would be beneficial considering they may still be at risk when they are in the presence of others who are drinking. Decision-making patterns also should be examined among different groups of students we know to be at increased risk for alcohol-related problems and/or sexual victimization (e.g., LGBTQ, international, racial/ethnic minority and first-generation students; those involved in Greek Life or with a history or prior victimization), as they may have unique prevention needs. Although a significant portion of our sample indicated intentions to join Greek Life, our data do not indicate who actually joined, and we were underpowered for the three-way interactions required to reliably examine group differences. Although EMA compliance was high (>90%), initial response and enrollment rates could be improved, perhaps by offering online/virtual training or higher incentives. To minimize respondent burden, the current study examined a limited set of theoretical constructs (i.e., intentions and willingness). Additional work is needed to examine contextual and intrapersonal decision-making factors (e.g., norms, attitudes, expectancies, perceived situational risk) at the event level to better understand malleable constructs that can be targeted by interventions. Further, we were unable to link PBS use to sexual assault outcomes because there was limited endorsement of unwanted sexual experiences on any of the 14 measured occasions. Although these associations are wellestablished using cross-sectional and non-diary longitudinal designs , linking PBS use and sexual assault outcomes at the event-level would uniquely inform prevention. Such a study would likely require a longer EMA data collection period (e.g., 30 days) and an event-contingent assessment method to capture outcomes tied to specific PBS use. Finally, our data were exclusively self-reported. The intrusive nature of repeated self-report data collection has been identified as a potential source of bias (e.g., reactivity to study procedures) and a threat to ecological validity . This work could be enhanced by incorporating unobtrusive data collection techniques, such as video diaries, biosensors, or geolocation data, which have the potential to eliminate self-report biases, provide robust monitoring of alcohol consumption, and add to our contextual understanding of PBS use (e.g., how decisions to use PBS are made at different levels of intoxication; whether decisions vary across social contexts or physical locations). Conclusion The current study was the first to examine event-level decisions to use both sexual assault and drinking PBS. The findings demonstrated decision-making constructs related to using sexual assault and drinking PBS among college women vary between people and at the event level, and unique intervention approaches may be needed to increase specific types of PBS. Findings from the study also highlight the need for both global and eventlevel intervention approaches to be tailored to women based on their current willingness and intentions to utilize PBS rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.
